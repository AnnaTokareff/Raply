Yeah, you gotta be cunnin'|Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin'|Walked in, said, ""This is a robbery""|Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby|Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag|I want money, beer, and a pack of Zig-Zags|The man in the back had a camera|So he came out to test his stamina|Against Eazy-E, but he took one|Fell to the floor, so I run|Back to the bucket, then I said, ""Punch it""|Took the gun and then dumped it|I'm not like Robin Hood, 'cause I want more|Steal from the rich, hang with the poor|My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me|I feel like nobody is badder than me|Is all that true? I don't lie|You see, I'm not Mr. Nice Guy|[Interlude]|Oh, so you're not exactly a role model?|Not exactly|And for your listeners, what does Eazy think of himself?||[Outro]|Bad and bold, you can't get with this|Those that tried, you're on my shit list|Can't be caught, sought or fought|Taught, and damn, it's your fault|Down and dirty from the C-P-T|N.W.A and Eazy-E|One more, before we end this session|What's your real age?

Eazy-E,Final Words,,"Final Words Lyrics""I may not seem like a guy you would pick to preach a sermon. But I feel it is now time to testify because I do have folks who care about me hearing all kinds of stuff about what's up.""||""Yeah, I was a brother on the streets of Compton doing a lot of things most people look down on -- but it did pay off. Then we started rapping about real stuff that shook up the LAPD and the FBI. But we got our message across big time, and everyone in America started paying attention to the boys in the 'hood.""||""Soon our anger and hope got everyone riled up. There were great rewards for me personally, like fancy cars, gorgeous women and good living. Like real non-stop excitement. I'm not religious, but wrong or right, that's me.""||""I'm not saying this because I'm looking for a soft cushion wherever I'm heading, I just feel that I've got thousands and thousands of young fans that have to learn about what's real when it comes to AIDS. Like the others before me, I would like to turn my own problem into something good that will reach out to all my homeboys and their kin. Because I want to save their asses before it's too late.""||""I'm not looking to blame anyone except myself. I have learned in the last week that this thing is real, and it doesn't discriminate. It affects everyone. My girl Tomika and I have been together for four years and we recently got married. She's good, she's kind and a wonderful mother. We have a little boy who's a year old. Before Tomika I had other women. I have seven children by six different mothers. Maybe success was too good to me. I love all my kids and always took care of them.""||""Now I'm in the biggest fight of my life, and it ain't easy. But I want to say much love to those who have been down to me. And thanks for your support.""|Just remember: it's YOUR real time and YOUR real life.Embed"
