Front row? Duh, bro, we don't sit on nosebleeds
 Ain't your pockets obese? They won't fit in those seats

<|endoftext|>
Ayy, we like a cold team, nigga, Shaq and Kobe
 Like back in '03, I was only like 6

<|endoftext|>
Shit, I was like 16, but I can give a sixteen
 I can make a bitch scream, that's a bit extreme

<|endoftext|>
I got a thick bald bitch, I call her Ms. Clean
 My drip frosty like Halls and Listerine

<|endoftext|>
I'm a thief in the night, pray to Jesus, to Christ
 Better hope he believe in your life

<|endoftext|>
Free my lil' nigga Saudi, was catching them bodies
 He fighting his demons to light

<|endoftext|>
Motherfucker better tuck and roll, got places to go
 And niggas missed the last flight, livin' in the fast life

<|endoftext|>
'Cause I switch it and flip it and cook it up mad nice
 'Til I see them flashlights, then I'm gone

<|endoftext|>
And your old friends be resenting you
 Like my women brown, and my Benjis blue

<|endoftext|>
Where I'm from niggas dying like Kenny do
 Take a hit of this PAC and this Henny juice

<|endoftext|>
Finally found a condo, that shit still feel like apartment
 Out South, my foul mouth started soundin' like Cartman

<|endoftext|>
I had my cake and ate it too, that shit is an acquired taste
 I promised I would buy a place, I got my favorite roommates

<|endoftext|>
My wifey yellin', "Who they?" My daughter yellin', "Hooray"
 I see it clear like Blu-Ray, I park it in the sky

<|endoftext|>
'Cause we gon' make it happen by any means
 A young nigga, dawg, but I done witnessed many things

<|endoftext|>
There's no complainin' on this side
 My niggas, shit is not tolerated

<|endoftext|>
I'm not really with the high flashin', it's no helpin' with my braggin'
 I penetrate it, been the greatest

<|endoftext|>
So when an old nigga talkin' I don't fuckin' listen
 They don't know, every day we make tough decisions

<|endoftext|>
And these supposed to be our heroes? Negro, please
 Old niggas unreliable like D-Rose knees

<|endoftext|>
And I get it, that's the mindset that's killin' the rhyme-fest
 But feedin' our families, lowering the crime, yet

<|endoftext|>
I'm chasing twenties, Benjamins, and breaking barriers too
 My family rich for generations, I might marry a Jew (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

<|endoftext|>
You might also like My lifestyle too wild, I know
 Everything change with a new high low

<|endoftext|>
Fifty bands, what I cashed in, my show
 I got that gas, this that hydro

<|endoftext|>
Syrup spilling, coughin' penicillin
 Heads turning walking in the building

<|endoftext|>
Ledge burnin' often I'm a villain
 Was deserted, brought up by some real ones

<|endoftext|>
I was stressing, blessings on the way
 Dropped out, no testing me today

<|endoftext|>
Impeach, nigga, ten deep, nigga
 Remember days we was wearin' J's

<|endoftext|>
Same niggas that I came with
 Premonitions over reminiscing

<|endoftext|>
Done seen some shit within my lifetime, my light shine bright
 Protect yo' energy from poison when the python strike

<|endoftext|>
Glock, no safety, Plaxico, I might shoot myself
 They catchin' bullets like two Odells, and, nigga, you gon' tell

<|endoftext|>
Beat a nigga, take his Bordeauxs, upgrade my wardrobe
 And Lord knows livin' like this, it leads a short road

<|endoftext|>
It's certain shit that I can't say on this song, but let me tell you, nigga I done seen some shit within my lifetime, at one time I
 Can still remember just how bad I used to want '5 mics'

<|endoftext|>
Shit'll make you wanna cop out like a plea deal
 So I treat a beat like it's Tekashi, spit on that bitch like Meek Mill

<|endoftext|>
My addiction got me weak-willed
 I'm relapsing, I think I can't seem to stop eating Beat Pills

<|endoftext|>
This is real life, ain't no actin' it
 All these rap niggas, they be Brad Pittin' (Uh)

<|endoftext|>
Like woah, hey, I keep that drip on me
 My nigga, I'm big homie (Big homie)

<|endoftext|>
You might also like I be feeling like it's me against the world
 But I can give a fuck who my opponent is (Nah)

<|endoftext|>
See, I was twelve years with the Tommy fit
 Fifteen, crankin' "Bobby Bitch"

<|endoftext|>
See these rap niggas biting my sound
 Shout out my bitch for holdin' it down

<|endoftext|>
But I'm Bill Clinton with these ill writtens, make the real listen
 Seen Monica Lewinsky in the Hills drippin'

<|endoftext|>
'Cause I'm on my grind, watch how I kickflip
 Money notorious, I'm buyin' big shit

<|endoftext|>
None of these niggas want smoke with me
 So hopefully my flow will breed

<|endoftext|>
Why everybody change on me?
 While I remain the same, that's why I'm bringing Major Payne

<|endoftext|>
I smash hotties and stash bodies, then cop lil' boats
 Like that's Yachty, and that's probably

<|endoftext|>
Why I'm so fly that I crash lobbies and after it slap thotties
 I'm a rap fanatic who rap fantastic without the platinum status

<|endoftext|>
I'm trying to find the stack, big as Blac Chyna's ass
 Oh you wack rhymers, trash climbers, that's kinda sad

<|endoftext|>
In a drive-by, where niggas shooting shit like Cole Bennett
 You ho's finished, in this rap shit a cold menace

<|endoftext|>
Uh, okay, we all got skeletons in our closet from a shady past
 Made me brag about my Mercedes, Jag

<|endoftext|>
Lately, sad
 Reminisce the times, please take me back

<|endoftext|>
Aimin' for the top, I'm on target like a Brady pass
 Did a show for eighty cash, and threw it in my lady bag

<|endoftext|>
Whoever said shit was easy forever lied
 I mesmerize, how simple decisions can jeopardize

<|endoftext|>
I climb hills, niggas was sleepin', on Nyquil
 Paint a picture vivid, dawg, on everything, my life's real

<|endoftext|>
See I know how it feels on the late nights, swimmin' with the great whites
 Drownin' in the deep waters, know you got three daughters

<|endoftext|>
Got me thinkin' like this can't be life
 These stupid ass niggas voted for the Antichrist

<|endoftext|>
In my city, to them kids, I'm like Jordan
 Every move I make like chess, it's important

<|endoftext|>
If truth is told, then you can grow and dyin' never
 No, I'm everlastin', better graspin' this thing in life

<|endoftext|>
Done seen some shit within my lifetime, my light shine bright
 Protect your energy from poison when the python strike

<|endoftext|>
Glock, no safety, Plaxico, I might shoot myself
 They catchin' bullets like two Odells, and, nigga, you gon' tell

<|endoftext|>
Beat a nigga, take his Bordeauxs, upgrade my wardrobe
 And Lord knows livin' like this, it leads a short road

<|endoftext|>
Tired of the struggle, livin' family in the subdivision
 Ramen noodles, drawin' doodles wasn't in my fuckin' vision

<|endoftext|>
And eventually flyin', lately been mentally cryin'
 Niggas resentin' me, I am not for the industry lyin' I can tell you how I first started in this rap shit

<|endoftext|>
You might also like Tryna find my way back home

I tell her every day, "Lady, you'll be havin' my baby"
 She say, "Yee! Lil' nigga, man, you hella crazy"

<|endoftext|>
Told her, "Bend it over while I break your back"
 Watch over my shoulder, don't take no slack

<|endoftext|>
Afraid of being forgotten, so this troll shit, we plottin'
 Sittin' on this phone for hours, feel my brain getting rotten

<|endoftext|>
But what's really important is such a silly distortion
 We all stuck in this matrix, tryna hide our misfortunes

<|endoftext|>
You might also like Uh, living in this false reality that's in this picture gallery
 Based on a nigga's profile, we guessin' salary

The lifestyle you advertise was quite strategized
 Make a minimal amount and then we maximize

The surface is much deeper than even the Earth is
 I searched it, lookin' for purpose like my first kiss

<|endoftext|>
My mind divine, this shit take me a lot farther
 Growing up, shit, I really had beef with my father

<|endoftext|>
Eight months with no phone, dawg, we aimin' for brilliance
 Hi-Level maintain in the building, nigga, we makin' a killin', woo (Oh) Lil' Tune flow sinister, I'ma finish ya

<|endoftext|>
Just like my keys, drop my genitals on her dental work
 My thots I keep confidential or it's consequential

<|endoftext|>
These diamond B's all VVs, I call em' Vivica
 Skatin' underneath a bridge, stay hustlin' as it is

<|endoftext|>
Make money, feed the kids, ain't nothin' in the fridge
 Wake up, repeat the sins, eight blunts, I needed ten

<|endoftext|>
I tried, you tell me I spend my time with all my guys
 Knowing we don't spend time

<|endoftext|>
As soon as I said that stupid shit, my gun had slipped into his grip
 My nigga, I plead the fifth, not needing this, man, I gotta dip

<|endoftext|>
Woman lie, a nigga lie, fuck the cell, that shit is dry
 "Why you pull me over doing 60 in a 55?"

<|endoftext|>
And the canines comin', you can stop with the jokes
 And while y'all in there tonight, don't be droppin' the soap"

<|endoftext|>
By the universe, the stars align, your love is far divine
 Plus I'm really glad you keep it G, that shit is hard to find

<|endoftext|>
We on the block where Jenny stays
 Honey baked ham with Henny glaze

<|endoftext|>
Abraham inheritance, shawty, we plenty paid
 Bonnie Clyde high speed chase, a renegade, but

<|endoftext|>
He done waste his time, too late
 I see he tryna contemplate

<|endoftext|>
I'm just thankin' God I ain't stressin' 'bout bills to pay
 I ain't havin' nothin' bad to say

<|endoftext|>
Learning lessons with my brethren, joy is quite contagious
 Counting blessings on blessings, my heart right to make it

<|endoftext|>
And it's kinda my only option, maybe my decisions
 Haven't really been the best, but this my life I'm livin'

<|endoftext|>
But that's the shit that make me rich and why we love the game
 And to my various enemies who carrying energy

<|endoftext|>
Comin' home to family struggles got me losin' focus
 I don't know how else to deal so it's too late now

<|endoftext|>
I got a brother out there who like 5 years old
 I don't know why daddy tried to hide your soul

<|endoftext|>
Bird's eye view, this shit panoramic
 Still fightin' off my paranoia, shit too real, just fired my lawyer

<|endoftext|>
Ski mask, black sweater, the daily attire
 It made me acquire effort, my lazy is fired

<|endoftext|>
I'm longevity chasing, you overnight viral
 I fight rivals, and stand taller than five Eiffels

<|endoftext|>
I'll be the first, never lied in rap
 I am a great, no denying that

<|endoftext|>
I switch the style, and I make it easy
 I changed my friend, because they was greedy

<|endoftext|>
I gotta grind and make every dollar
 My money stronger than Larry Lobster

<|endoftext|>
Say, "Hello", nigga, little ho nigga
 Bitch-ass broke nigga, nah, I can't roll with ya, huh

 Ain't no cappin', I say it, I got it

<|endoftext|>
I'm with two hoes like a shotty
 I'm shittin' on these niggas, no potty

<|endoftext|>
I been hidin' from the world
 The only thing seein' me right now is the sky and the projects

<|endoftext|>
I came in the game with a chip on my shoulder
 Looking at the competition, all these niggas is older

<|endoftext|>
'Till I hopped in the fast lane, reminiscing my past pains
 Carry it, the cash came, heritage from my last name (Uh)

<|endoftext|>
I'm from a tribe of brilliance, I buy the building
 Please hide the children, I'm 'bout to go on a killing spree

<|endoftext|>
Plotting what I'm 'bout to accomplish, quite enormous
 I don't have to write to forfeit, my nigga my life a story

<|endoftext|>
Call Spike Lee, tell him how I made it off of type beats
 I might be the nicest with the handles since Kyrie

<|endoftext|>
My nigga, I bleed terrific and piss excellence
 My shit heaven sent, flowing like a sick veteran

Two toned drip might damage ya
 Hit a nigga quick, no camera

<|endoftext|>
Six months, live with my manager
 I was down bad on my ass, with no cash in the bag, now I'm finally manning up

<|endoftext|>
I realized with money that vanity is less important
 Feeling like LeBron with plans of catching Jordan

<|endoftext|>
Nothing ordinary
 I been having vivid dreams, them shits is more than scary

<|endoftext|>
Taking risks, situations getting magnified
 What's your ideal way of demise?

<|endoftext|>
Seven figure checks, they require my signature
 Drive-by shootings, homicides are vehicular

<|endoftext|>
I ain't dropped a song in a year, my fans is happy to wait
 Designer music, turned my album in fashionably late

<|endoftext|>
But honestly, what is we doing it for?
 My happiness, I’m still pursuing the source

<|endoftext|>
I'm waking up in cold sweats with no sex, although vexed
 My energy I gotta protect, where will I go next?

<|endoftext|>
Everything's interconnected and it's all by design
 Yin and yang and since the big bang, ain't shit change

<|endoftext|>
Sometimes I feel like Russell Wilson, other days I'm Rick James
 Life is a balance, duality is one of my talents

<|endoftext|>
Okay, sometimes I fantasize about life then I analyze
 The missing pieces, this written thesis, I can't advise

<|endoftext|>
Quite remedial, the type to see it through
 I write for me and you, accomplish shit that isn't feasible

<|endoftext|>
A real nigga what I'm is and what I always remain
 But this bitch temptation keep callin’ my name

<|endoftext|>
Simply vessels in this climate, solitary confinement
 I break free every time that I wake

<|endoftext|>
My fate bleeds and create seeds that eventually blossom to trees
 Getting rid of all the extra shit I thought I would need

<|endoftext|>
Couldn’t break the cycle, like recycle, they wan' see us back
 Eighteen, lions, tigers, bears, I was livin’ with 'em (Mm)

<|endoftext|>
She had a desire to sing and I admire these things
 At times a nigga feel guilty I retired her dreams

<|endoftext|>
Niggas formin' their opinions based on shit that they read
 I be dealin' with a lot, I take this shit to the head

<|endoftext|>
No complainin', though this shit is ultra drainin'
 My whole life is a canvas, I'm supposed to paint it

<|endoftext|>
Caught up in a matrix, shit I had to find a way out
 Lost too many niggas, swear this shit is gettin' played out

<|endoftext|>
Boy my gas be supreme, not a damn jacket
 I ran rapid, sheep niggas with lamb habits

<|endoftext|>
I went to Westlake High where death rates rise
 And some people go on to waste the rest they lives

<|endoftext|>
Who can withstand the test of time? As it's a guess of mine
 Here in real life homie, this is not a set design

<|endoftext|>
I made my first million by age twenty with slave money
 When I signed my first deal, I was hungry and played dummy

<|endoftext|>
'Till I started Hi-Level and signed fly rebels who buy bezels
 The truth is they want you to die ghetto

<|endoftext|>
I'm diabolic, try a psychedelic
 I nevеr try to relish in the sweet moments like a diabetic

<|endoftext|>
Promise that I'm never lackin' 'til I'm stadium status

You got no confidence, I rose to prominence
 Straight dominance, I ain't with that fake kickin' shit, let's keep it ominous

<|endoftext|>
That dark energy bring back the park memories
 I already defeated pain and fought misery

<|endoftext|>
Like Jada and Styles P, I got the key to the locks
 Still thinkin' 'bout that cash, knee-deep in the box

<|endoftext|>
Difference is my lyrics is dope, spirit is better
 My figures in cheddar, I get it from ambitious endeavours

Darth Vader, heart breaker, real nigga, they faker
 Word to Belichick, I'm a playmaker

I can't lie on a verse, generational curse I'm tryin' to reverse
 I'm still in the trenches, on my phone and I'm dealin' with business

<|endoftext|>
I'm just gon' keep it real with my niggas
 I got drip on me, I'm drenchin'

<|endoftext|>
I'm undefeated for several reasons, I bring disaster
 We need to see the pastor

<|endoftext|>
Pride gun, I tuck it back
 Life crazy, my luck gets bad

<|endoftext|>
The life I live I couldn't make it up
 And my phone on silent, I've been hidin'

<|endoftext|>
They want me to call, but I been on an island
 And all that's on my mind is how am I to find the way I'm tryin' (The way I'm tryin')

<|endoftext|>
Ayy, I'm sick of all these hoes, I'm sick of all the highs and the lows (All the highs and lows)
 Nowadays I don't know every time, I go I don't wanna be home

<|endoftext|>
And if I choose it you know my choice is the music
 So I'm saying goodbye, you just apart of my old life

<|endoftext|>
But please, baby, pay attention 'cause I cause pray they miss you You see it's always sunshine after the rain
 And it's always some crying, laughter and pain

<|endoftext|>
And we was catching the bus, but never missing a meal
 But I appreciate the times, it made a nigga for real

Worldwide tours, I be filling rooms (Real)
 I do it for the kids that be feeling doom (Nah, for real)

<|endoftext|>
This that heat seekers for the deep thinkers
 I might take a trip to LA Leakers (Uh)

<|endoftext|>
Droppin' mixtapes and creatin' plans
 Manifestation, God's creation

<|endoftext|>
My mind is hectic, thoughts eclectic
 At times I felt disrespected by the genre I love

<|endoftext|>
This is for back in the days
 Before the accolades, packing the stage

<|endoftext|>
A work man is worthy of his hire
 I'm only inspired by legacy and early desires

<|endoftext|>
I can see a war is coming, this feeling's enormous
 It's time to kill these niggas, man (Ooh)

<|endoftext|>
Uh, we're takin' over the the racist motive, the hatred's older
 The empire's retired, I'm just an ageist Yoda

<|endoftext|>
I mean let's say we begin and being lazy's a sin
 You rather get crazy with friends til you staging your end

<|endoftext|>
I mean I never understood but each is it own
 I'm reminded of my faults when I'm deep in the zone

<|endoftext|>
Because I learn, I learn all from my mistakes
 I try to get it, I get in in different kind of ways

<|endoftext|>
I'm 'bout to wild today and cheer like it's 2008
 Back when "My president is black" was something proud to say

<|endoftext|>
'cause shit I haven't seen change and Uzi drive a green Range
 And life is draining everybody's hope, it's such a mean game

<|endoftext|>
Making deals with bills, I gotta face the timing
 But I'm ill with skills, a nigga patient minded

<|endoftext|>
The beat killed and drilled, I gotta face the violence
 It's flu season, these niggas hating for two reasons

<|endoftext|>
I'm too great with a new tape, like dude wait
 I'm like Biggie, I'm hopping to never lose faith

<|endoftext|>
'Cause honestly I been dope since the eight grade
 So make way 'cause a nigga on a mayday

But, I thought my last one was a ride or die

 Love for the passion writing, but dying a crashing Viking

At times I be the only enemy just fighting my dreams
 This rap shit is whole my life, it's like a pipe to a fiend

<|endoftext|>
Or better yet, no metaphor, it's like a mic to a me

 Do whatever suits me like Louis Vuitton, one of a kind, the don

Quick take a sip
 Bitches know I'm packin like a trip

<|endoftext|>
.223 have you watching me like kappa
 Now I'm movin' from my past life, my brother got stabbed twice

<|endoftext|>
Runnin' 'round the town and these villains want my crown

Remember when you dropped Training Day and they hated you

And my Bugatti, I park it. Issey Miyake my closet

Plus, like the pills you're popping, the way to deal has got 'em
 Straight up going insane. It ain't flowing the same

<|endoftext|>
Sad that I sold my soul for money, the hoes and gold
 I'm stressed and blowing dope because the Holy Ghost

<|endoftext|>
Made the wrong decision, like the longest living
 But got the strongest vision, clouded by thongs on women

 So, be glad, your teeth's mad, she hates it

 Talking about this trapper, how he went to jail, now he paid

<|endoftext|>
Took his girl, now this nigga bout to blow a fuse
 I don't even take it serious, I'm so amused

<|endoftext|>
Why stress over life? It's a beautiful day

I swear that kills my drive, yeah, my last gear
 Cuz I've been wanting and watching you for the past year

'Cause we gon' make it happen by any means
 A young nigga, dawg, but I done witnessed many things

<|endoftext|>
Look, ice on my wrist
 Dirty Sprite in the zip

<|endoftext|>
I am a great, no denying that
 I spit the higher than fire tracks

 Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack

And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
 I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table

<|endoftext|>
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
 It's actually disastrously bad for the wack

<|endoftext|>
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
 "Oy vey, that boy's gay!"—that's all they say, lookin' boy

<|endoftext|>
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
 Appeal with the skin color of mine

<|endoftext|>
I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
 Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine

<|endoftext|>
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
 The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"

<|endoftext|>
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
 For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating

<|endoftext|>
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
 But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling

<|endoftext|>
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
 Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked

<|endoftext|>
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
 Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)

<|endoftext|>
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
 In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name

<|endoftext|>
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
 He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out

<|endoftext|>
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
 There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't

<|endoftext|>
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
 His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope

<|endoftext|>
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
 When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's

<|endoftext|>
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
 Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping

<|endoftext|>
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
 These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows

<|endoftext|>
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
 God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father

<|endoftext|>
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
 But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water

<|endoftext|>
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
 They moved on to the next schmoe who flows

<|endoftext|>
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
 I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed

<|endoftext|>
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
 All the pain inside amplified by the

<|endoftext|>
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
 Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family

<|endoftext|>
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
 This may be the only opportunity that I got

<|endoftext|>
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
 Same reason I wrestle with mania

<|endoftext|>
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
 In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate

<|endoftext|>
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
 This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A

<|endoftext|>
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
 Risperdal, voices whisper

<|endoftext|>
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
 We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem

<|endoftext|>
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
 Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people

<|endoftext|>
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
 I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto

<|endoftext|>
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
 Other words, I Minute Maid 'em

<|endoftext|>
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
 I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla

<|endoftext|>
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
 Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter

<|endoftext|>
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
 I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable

<|endoftext|>
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
 Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!

<|endoftext|>
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
 Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'

<|endoftext|>
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
 I ain't here to save the fuckin' children

<|endoftext|>
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
 Maybe I need a straightjacket

<|endoftext|>
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
 It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

<|endoftext|>
Let's recap, way back, MC's that (What?)
 Wreak havoc on tape decks (Woo)

<|endoftext|>
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
 We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back

<|endoftext|>
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
 Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin

<|endoftext|>
It better be at least seventy or three-hundred milligram
 And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again

<|endoftext|>
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
 Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater

<|endoftext|>
Let me explain just how to make greatness
 Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down

<|endoftext|>
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
 To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows

<|endoftext|>
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
 Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós

<|endoftext|>
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
 Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench

<|endoftext|>
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
 Like Vice President Mike Pence

<|endoftext|>
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
 Jesus Christ, man, how many times is

<|endoftext|>
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
 Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)

<|endoftext|>
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
 Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne

<|endoftext|>
I don't see why y'all even started with me
 I get in beefs, my enemies die

<|endoftext|>
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
 Give me Donkey of the Day

<|endoftext|>
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
 I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds

<|endoftext|>
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
 But I know at least he's heard it

<|endoftext|>
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
 To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him

<|endoftext|>
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
 Remember when we met in Denver?

<|endoftext|>
So the FCC won't let me be
 Or let me be me, so let me see

<|endoftext|>
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
 Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa

<|endoftext|>
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
 Ain't no telling when this chokehold

<|endoftext|>
Chased it with straight liquor
 Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint

<|endoftext|>
So she's been on the web lately
 Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man

<|endoftext|>
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
 Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"

<|endoftext|>
After the first night, but tonight I am A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
 It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...

<|endoftext|>
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
 Don't have to be reserved in a booth

<|endoftext|>
Fuck!
 You might also like Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"

<|endoftext|>
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
 And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes

<|endoftext|>
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
 That's why I may have came at you sideways

<|endoftext|>
I can't keep my lies straight
 But I made you terminate my baby

<|endoftext|>
It's the return of the "Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
 He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"

<|endoftext|>
Feminist women love Eminem
 "Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him

<|endoftext|>
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
 Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets

<|endoftext|>
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
 Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?

<|endoftext|>
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
 So I guess it ain't that aftershave

<|endoftext|>
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rock Steady Crew
 Obviously, I'm not getting through

<|endoftext|>
Better hope I don't call Trick Trick
 Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city

<|endoftext|>
Punk, you don't disrespect OGs, R.I.P. Prodigy
 Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me

<|endoftext|>
That I'd be the most hated, though made it
 So that there's no shame, it's okay to own it

<|endoftext|>
I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hanging open
 My code name is groper, I role play with lotion

<|endoftext|>
I fucked on the world then I throw away the Trojan
 Old lederhosen with home-made explosives

<|endoftext|>
I'll blow eighty holes in you
 Don't make me go in, I O. J. the flows

<|endoftext|>
I'm a fucking invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick
 A little bit unpredictable, I spit the formidable

<|endoftext|>
None come close to skunk, bug, soldier
 Tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older

<|endoftext|>
Sponge, mug, folder, nun, rug, holster
 Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster

<|endoftext|>
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
 Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace

<|endoftext|>
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
 And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks

<|endoftext|>
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
 And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem

<|endoftext|>
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
 If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first

<|endoftext|>
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
 I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers

<|endoftext|>
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
 A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

<|endoftext|>
Now, while he stands tough
 Notice that this man did not have his hands up

<|endoftext|>
And Wink did fuck my girl
 I'm still standin' here screaming, "Fuck the Free World!"

<|endoftext|>
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
 And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe

<|endoftext|>
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
 As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight

<|endoftext|>
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
 She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — "Wait!

<|endoftext|>
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
 I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

<|endoftext|>
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
 I snapped, "Who's that dude?", I don't even know his name

<|endoftext|>
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
 Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me

<|endoftext|>
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
 Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano

<|endoftext|>
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
 Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball

<|endoftext|>
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
 I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry

<|endoftext|>
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
 I'll ride through your cul-de-sac

<|endoftext|>
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
 Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it

<|endoftext|>
Which is why I identify with the guy
 Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein

<|endoftext|>
Energized like a nine volt
 Ice cold like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll

<|endoftext|>
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
 Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (Ooh)

<|endoftext|>
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
 Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me

<|endoftext|>
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
 'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone

<|endoftext|>
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go
 Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to—

<|endoftext|>
You might also like I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
 There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that

<|endoftext|>
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
 Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'

<|endoftext|>
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
 Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening

<|endoftext|>
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
 As pressure increases like khakis

<|endoftext|>
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
 Like, "This shit is garbage!"

<|endoftext|>
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
 A flawed human, I guess

<|endoftext|>
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
 Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this!"

<|endoftext|>
You might also like I've been drivin' around your side of this town
 Like nine frickin' hours and forty-five minutes now

<|endoftext|>
And it's now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
 My knife is out and I'm duckin' on the side of your house

<|endoftext|>
See, it's sad it came to this point
 Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment

<|endoftext|>
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
 And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy

<|endoftext|>
Two more exits, time is quite near
 Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear

<|endoftext|>
Slim: "Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"
 Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge

<|endoftext|>
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
 Babysit? You make me sick

<|endoftext|>
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
 Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?

<|endoftext|>
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
 Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life

 What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
 Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind

<|endoftext|>
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
 To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes

<|endoftext|>
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
 Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'

<|endoftext|>
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
 My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't

<|endoftext|>
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
 I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away, man, I'll come down in a couple of days

<|endoftext|>
You might also like I'm alive again
 More alive than I have been in my whole entire life, I can (Yeah)

<|endoftext|>
They call me a freak, 'cause
 I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (Haha)

<|endoftext|>
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
 The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (Yeah)

<|endoftext|>
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
 I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (Uh)

<|endoftext|>
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
 I'll be one tough act to follow

<|endoftext|>
On my ass and pissed and moaned
 Or take this situation in which I'm placed in

<|endoftext|>
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
 'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen

<|endoftext|>
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
 You're kickin' me out? It's fifteen degrees

<|endoftext|>
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
 And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but—

<|endoftext|>
You might also like ‘Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
 ‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow

Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause— I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
 I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post

<|endoftext|>
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
 What? Like I give a fuck! I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck

<|endoftext|>
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
 And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook

<|endoftext|>
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
 With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt

<|endoftext|>
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
 I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut

<|endoftext|>
"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?"
 "I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy

<|endoftext|>
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
 Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing

<|endoftext|>
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
 "You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?"

<|endoftext|>
"Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more" "Daddy, you're lyin'!
 You always say that, you always say this is the last time

<|endoftext|>
Put it to my brain, scream, "Die, Shady!" and pop it
 The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was

<|endoftext|>
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
 At anything that may stand in they way

<|endoftext|>
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
 And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay

<|endoftext|>
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
 I’m turnin’ back to a madman, can't take

<|endoftext|>
Fuck, I still can't say this shit, but how quickly they forget
 Who the fuck I was; now Ninja try to duck my slugs

<|endoftext|>
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
 Give you a shout—now get the fuck out my rhyme book

<|endoftext|>
That's why I call the motherfuckers M16s (Woo!)
 Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee

<|endoftext|>
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
 But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)

<|endoftext|>
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
 I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler

<|endoftext|>
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
 (Huh, yup)

<|endoftext|>
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
 Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be

<|endoftext|>
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
 Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off

<|endoftext|>
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
 Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad

<|endoftext|>
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
 And it's burnin', and I have returned I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired

<|endoftext|>
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
 'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy), I can't take it

<|endoftext|>
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
 And I'm thankful for every fan that I get

<|endoftext|>
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
 Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph

<|endoftext|>
Judgement is clouded; must
 Just be the powder from the power of (Love!)

<|endoftext|>
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts—brace!
 Hope it ain't, "Here we go, yo!"

<|endoftext|>
Like you should fuckin' beat it
 Or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period

<|endoftext|>
Here goes that broken record cliché
 It's all my fault anyway, she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break

<|endoftext|>
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
 Each day is an Instant Replay

<|endoftext|>
That's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
 Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline

<|endoftext|>
Like, "Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab"
 I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy

<|endoftext|>
Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great
 But wait, think there's been a mistake

<|endoftext|>
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
 I have infinite hate in my blood

<|endoftext|>
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
 Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders

<|endoftext|>
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
 While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man

<|endoftext|>
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
 This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business

<|endoftext|>
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
 Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him

<|endoftext|>
That we've just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
 And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind

<|endoftext|>
Nobody knows me, I'm cold
 Walk down this road all alone

<|endoftext|>
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
 Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfuckin' hoes

<|endoftext|>
Somethin' I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions, so it's over
 It's like an explosion every time I hold ya

<|endoftext|>
Nigga, we made it, made it, they hate it, hate it
 Pro professional, pure persistent, I'm paper chasing

<|endoftext|>
I hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience
 But I hate to pay a bill (Hate that)

<|endoftext|>
Eight niggas, eight hittas, take eight souls (Brrr)
 Collect pesos (Huh), and I'm paid, so? (Paid)

<|endoftext|>
To the sky is where my brain goes (Wow)
 Same pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (Wow)

<|endoftext|>
Case closed, bodies in my lane, bitch, lane closed Game over, Thanos on you H-O's
 On my petty shit but I don't paint toes (Yeah)

<|endoftext|>
But I'm contemplating yelling "Bombs away" on the game
 Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting Man, I don't see why they hate me (Huh?)

<|endoftext|>
But I know magic and here go my last trick
 I'm 'bout to say "Abracadabra" and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat

<|endoftext|>
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlyin' problems
 Thinkin' he can try and solve 'em

<|endoftext|>
I'm outside chalkin' up drawings
 On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'

<|endoftext|>
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
 ‘Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'

<|endoftext|>
So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins
 It's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins

<|endoftext|>
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
 You don't respect the legacy I leave behind, y'all can

<|endoftext|>
Like whatever they say has no bearing
 It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing

<|endoftext|>
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
 There's no control, he just lets his emotions go Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters

<|endoftext|>
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
 Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)

<|endoftext|>
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
 But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously

<|endoftext|>
Atop the Empire State Buildin'
 This shit is like child's play, childrеn

<|endoftext|>
I will anni-nihilate, kill them
 I'll fuck around and pile еight million

<|endoftext|>
Ain't nothin' you say could ever trump (Nah), mic, pencil get killed (Yeah)
 If you're hypersensitive, I wasn't referencin' the vice president, chill (Chill)

<|endoftext|>
I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill, violence but with skill
 That's why I hence when I write ends up with the mic and pencil gettin' killed (Haha, yeah, hold up)

<|endoftext|>
Like claws, I can swing right for your jaw
 And rip it off with one swipe of the paw

<|endoftext|>
20/20 hindsight in my side mirror
 Every year, you drop the ball like Times Square

<|endoftext|>
And I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
 Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy

<|endoftext|>
I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded
 Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia

<|endoftext|>
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
 Find different ways to word the same old song

<|endoftext|>
Ever since I came along
 From the day the song called “Hi! My Name Is” dropped

<|endoftext|>
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion 80 times
 How many times can I say the same thing

<|endoftext|>
Different ways that rhyme?
 What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story, bet you feel the same way I felt

<|endoftext|>
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows and I'm frozen
 ‘Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from

<|endoftext|>
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
 I just open enough eyes later on

<|endoftext|>
The legend of the angry blonde
 Lives on through you when I’m gone, and to think I was a—

<|endoftext|>
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
 What's this bitch, retarded? Give me back my sixteen dollars!

<|endoftext|>
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
 Whatever happened to wilin' out and being violent?

<|endoftext|>
You might also like Vanilla Ice don't like me (Uh-uh), he said some shit in Vibe to spite me (Yo)
 Then went and dyed his hair just like me (Haha)

<|endoftext|>
And I don't need help from D12 to beat up two females
 In make-up who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails

<|endoftext|>
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
 "Oh, he just did some shit with Missy

<|endoftext|>
Come on, relax, guy! I like gay men
 Right, Ken? Give me an amen! (A-men!)

<|endoftext|>
"Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
 Heal this child, help us destroy these demons

<|endoftext|>
You can't teach me a goddamn thing 'cause
 I watch TV and Comcast cable

<|endoftext|>
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em-
 -inem and Kim combined (The maniac's in)

<|endoftext|>
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
 Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place

<|endoftext|>
So I'll be disguised in it and if anybody identifies
 The guy in it, I hide for five minutes

<|endoftext|>
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
 Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business

<|endoftext|>
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
 To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut

<|endoftext|>
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
 To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass

<|endoftext|>
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playing
 Thinkin' I'm sayin' this shit 'cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it (Ahh)

<|endoftext|>
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
 I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile vicious

<|endoftext|>
Vain Vicodin, *vrin vrin vrin!*
 Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all

<|endoftext|>
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts Bitch, I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
 In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you

<|endoftext|>
'Cause ladies' screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
 And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks

<|endoftext|>
These 80 G's a week to say the same things tweece
 Twice, whatever, I hate these things

<|endoftext|>
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got the machete from O. J.​
 I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache

<|endoftext|>
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
 Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)

<|endoftext|>
Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)
 I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now

<|endoftext|>
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)
 But I still remember the days of

<|endoftext|>
When you struggle with despair
 That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair

<|endoftext|>
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
 But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack

<|endoftext|>
Give me that inkling and mo–
 –tivation to go, Hussein with the flow

<|endoftext|>
Fanny packs, hourglasses
 If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste

<|endoftext|>
I'm so much like my father, you would think that I knew him
 I keep pacin' this room, Valium, then chase it with booze

<|endoftext|>
But it's almost as though I don't hear no sound
 I should get ready for the show now

<|endoftext|>
But it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact
 Then something told me relax

<|endoftext|>
With no prior convictions, so law says sky's the limit
 So my supply's infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier

<|endoftext|>
'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference
 (Hello, darkness, my old friend)

<|endoftext|>
I'm in a strange place
 I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith

<|endoftext|>
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
 Grimmin' every stranger in the place while I gaze into space

<|endoftext|>
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
 I'm goin' all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is, I'm strapped for battle

<|endoftext|>
Lorena said I never can leave her
 She'll sever my wiener I ever deceive her

<|endoftext|>
Ever since 19946 Dresden it was definitely in my destiny
 When on the steps, I met DeShaun at Osborn

<|endoftext|>
Made 'em break out the popcorn
 Now I've been hip hop in its tip-top form

<|endoftext|>
Oh, LMFAO, no way, Jo-
 -se Baez couldn't beat this rap—O.J., no

<|endoftext|>
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony, hey ho (Hey ho!)
 I sound like I'm tryna sing the fuckin' chorus to "Hip Hop Hooray"

<|endoftext|>
Superman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
 Don't try to fix me, I'm broke, so I don't work

<|endoftext|>
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
 Can't count how many times I vomited, cried

<|endoftext|>
That G shall surely see, he definitely is 'bout it
 As retail fraud, he's weak, the honest gesture

<|endoftext|>
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
 Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away

<|endoftext|>
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
 Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines

<|endoftext|>
It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery
 And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script

<|endoftext|>
Ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio—eat a dick!
 I still never ABC this shit

<|endoftext|>
Mainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller
 Since before they called Jay Dee "Dilla"

<|endoftext|>
Seems to be reachin' its fever pitch
 Hundred and eighty degrees in here

<|endoftext|>
As days begin to tick away, but ain't this really
 What made me into the angry bitter blonde?

<|endoftext|>
But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs?
 Don't make me unleash this shit, release this pit

<|endoftext|>
May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit
 Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit

<|endoftext|>
Is playin' with you, but ain't shit changin'
 It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer

<|endoftext|>
Who would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
 With some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear

<|endoftext|>
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
 Waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat

<|endoftext|>
Watchin' me while I write this, like, "I don't like this note!"
 All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy

<|endoftext|>
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
 We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine

<|endoftext|>
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
 To the sixties, having black skin is risky

<|endoftext|>
'Cause this keeps happening
 Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit

<|endoftext|>
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...
 You might also like Seems like the average lifespan of a white man

<|endoftext|>
Is more than twice than a black life span
 I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner

<|endoftext|>
And education sucks, and every day's another
 Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz

<|endoftext|>
The poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in
 The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence

<|endoftext|>
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
 In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals

<|endoftext|>
(*Scratches*) My name is Slim Shady
 I been crazy way before radio didn't play me

<|endoftext|>
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic whose eyes get so squinted
 I'm blind from smoke in 'em with my windows tinted

<|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, Puff, but I don't give a fuck
 If this chick was my own mother, I'd still fuck her with no rubber

<|endoftext|>
Segregation is bein' told where I'm gonna go
 Separation is bein' woke and goin' wherever I wanna go Never sold dope for no gold rope

<|endoftext|>
Like a lint roller they wait 'til it's late, they will tiptoe
 Through your living room window

<|endoftext|>
Started to spit vulgar, my ZIP code had been skid row
 But I ate every single beat that I spit over, the shithole I escaped

<|endoftext|>
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless, the light that you're seekin'
 It begins to seep in, that's the only thing keepin'

<|endoftext|>
You tryin' to flip this on me? If I spent more time with you, you say
 "Okay, yeah, and I'm coo-coo, eh?" — Well, screw you

<|endoftext|>
But you ain't and I can't see you when you make that wittle boo-boo face
 'Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo, you make my fuckin' Bluetooth ache

<|endoftext|>
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched, yeah, I'm rich as a bitch
 But bitches ain't shit, I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch

<|endoftext|>
Oye-yoy-yoy, man-oh-man, your boy-boy-boy's
 Gettin' sick of these girls-girls-girls, oink-oink-oink

<|endoftext|>
Act Hollywood like they play for the Lakers
 They fly on the latest

<|endoftext|>
Crocs, alligators, say hi to my haters
 Pardon my neighbor

<|endoftext|>
It's a-okay though, whippin' up whip like it's mayo
 Every track is a K.O., technical K.O. Go off your head like I'm Ayo

<|endoftext|>
Go nigga, you ain't break no rules (Hell yeah!)
 High school, niggas ate yo' food (Food)

<|endoftext|>
Shit is O.C. lately (Yeah)
 Gotta break 'em off with these Dre beats (Yeah)

<|endoftext|>
But I'm tryna come up like JAY-Z (Like JAY-Z)
 Nothin' but love for my idols (Love for my idols)

<|endoftext|>
But nowadays every flow, every cadence sound the same (Skrrt)
 Brain's a powder keg, I draw inspiration outta hate

<|endoftext|>
It's 'cause I'm an alien, that's why
 I write 'til the page is outta space (Duh!)

<|endoftext|>
Idiotic from the fuckin' embryonic sac
 To the body bag, I'll be back

<|endoftext|>
The side of loco-motive with rap, I'm
 Loco, it's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun

<|endoftext|>
Laughin' all the way to the bank, lampin' in my K-Mart mansion
 I’m in the style department

<|endoftext|>
'Cause I'm promoting my passion 'til I'm passed out
 Completely brain-dead: Rain Man

<|endoftext|>
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
 I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady

<|endoftext|>
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
 Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview

<|endoftext|>
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
 I'm convinced I'm a fiend

<|endoftext|>
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
 Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes

<|endoftext|>
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
 Went to gym in eighth grade, ***** the women's swim team

<|endoftext|>
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
 To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action

<|endoftext|>
My rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
 I travel through your mind and chill your spine like siren drills

<|endoftext|>
Imitator intimidator, stimulator
 Simulator of data, eliminator

<|endoftext|>
It eases you mentally, gently
 Sentimentally, instrumentally

<|endoftext|>
‘Cause once you make an instant hit, I'm tensed a bit
 And tempted when I see the sins my friends commit

<|endoftext|>
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
 I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated

<|endoftext|>
Fair weather, wishy-washy
 She thinks machine washed me (What?)

<|endoftext|>
Mile-high club (Why?), I give a flying fuck (Fly and fuck, no)
 Punchliner just tryin' to survive in this climate of vaginas (Bitch)

<|endoftext|>
Who dyin' to cancel my ass like Aunt Jemima syrup
 I'm a shit-stirrer, you're a dime-a

<|endoftext|>
And diplomatic as I'm tryna be
 Last thing I need is Snoop doggin' me

<|endoftext|>
Crown around it, thorns on it
 Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?

<|endoftext|>
How 'bout that? I’m somehow now back to the underdog
 But no matter how loud that I bark

<|endoftext|>
I'm tryna be headstrong
 But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong

<|endoftext|>
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
 Why am I online? It's driving me crazy

<|endoftext|>
But as days pass in this shit
 And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say

<|endoftext|>
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow, and I'm not gonna be…
 You might also like I want it, I'm comin' to get it

<|endoftext|>
I'm still not leaving, stop for no one, I don't know
 But I've been told, an obstacle that blocks your road, ya

<|endoftext|>
Khalil on the beat, ‘cause makin' the beat
 Ain’t the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is

<|endoftext|>
Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz
 Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone

<|endoftext|>
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
 'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill

<|endoftext|>
Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco
 (We did it) My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk

<|endoftext|>
Women dishin' but really thinkin': "If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him."
 Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit

<|endoftext|>
My soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin'
 A black hole and I'm swallowin' this track whole

<|endoftext|>
Better pack toilet paper, but I'm takin' no crap, ho
 Here I go down the Bat Pole

<|endoftext|>
Only women that I love are my daughters
 But sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father

<|endoftext|>
Yeah, cocky, and can’t knock bein' rude off, so fear not, my dear
 And dry up your teardrops, I'm here

<|endoftext|>
You might also like Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
 And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink

<|endoftext|>
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
 Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old

<|endoftext|>
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
 Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady

<|endoftext|>
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
 At the same Walmart, arguin' over the same cart

<|endoftext|>
And I gave him the gas face
 And this ain't got nothin' to do with a scale

<|endoftext|>
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey
 Tyler, the Creator, and Violent J

<|endoftext|>
I'm insane, every rhyme I say
 Sons you like an ultra-violet ray

<|endoftext|>
In the meantime it’s always mean time, I'm gettin'— I’ve been a career asshole
 I don’t see why these people always got my back

<|endoftext|>
But your baggage ain't gon' fit in my storage overhead space
 'Cause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods

<|endoftext|>
I need my meds, I peed my bed
 I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down

<|endoftext|>
No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
 Someone help me, I think my face is melting

<|endoftext|>
If you felt these migraines
 And see these maggots eat my brain

<|endoftext|>
Told these hoes shut their P-I-E holes, now peep my game
 'Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it

<|endoftext|>
I'm outta control like no other mic go
 Stab you 'til the knife goes – dull

<|endoftext|>
And ride it like a motorbike
 I'm finna blow the mic the whole night, so

<|endoftext|>
Strike up the fuckin' maestro, I'm nitro
 And hi, ho, hand me my shovel!

<|endoftext|>
To be a housewife who outright lies
 She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive

<|endoftext|>
I ran outside, why is she tryna act out?
 She's just about my size, hit me in the mouth twice

<|endoftext|>
I'm takin' two-by-fours to our eight-by-tens
 Bitch, it's you I tore out the frame, I win

<|endoftext|>
Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in
 After you, I swore to make the grey skies end

<|endoftext|>
It's like a dream come true, just to scream "Fuck you!" (Fuck you!)
 Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then

<|endoftext|>
This game will make you go crazy
 'Bout to go for B-R-O-K-E

<|endoftext|>
They said that they hated the awake me
 I lose the rage, I'm too tame

<|endoftext|>
They probably feel the same way because lately
 Instead of us being credited for longevity

<|endoftext|>
I'm gonna cum, I am! Okay, I'm done, I already came twice
 You ain't gonna make me cum

<|endoftext|>
Without someone passin' through my sub, harassin'
 I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math

<|endoftext|>
I think my karma's catchin' up with me
 You might also like I'm tryin' to be low-key, hopefully nobody notices me

<|endoftext|>
In produce, hunched over, giant nosebleed
 Ogre style as I mosey over to the frozen aisle

<|endoftext|>
I'm at a crossroads, lost, still shoppin' at Costco's
 Sloppy Joe's, bulk waffles

<|endoftext|>
Takin' forever to change, it's stuck, these bitches are lovin' it
 Rubbin' it in, chucklin', couldn't do nothin'

<|endoftext|>
Wrong subdivision to fuck with, bitch
 Quit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids

<|endoftext|>
I love my city, but you pushed me to the limit—what a pity!
 The shit I complain about

<|endoftext|>
Sit back, homie, relax, in fact, grab a six pack
 Kick back while I kick facts, yeah, Dre—sick track

<|endoftext|>
I'm obsessed now, oh gee
 Is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee?

<|endoftext|>
How many times you fly to my house, still tryin' to count
 Better shut your lyin' mouth if you don't want Nick findin' out

<|endoftext|>
Sometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might
 Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?

<|endoftext|>
And show these people what my level of skill's like
 But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life

<|endoftext|>
Somethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights
 Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like

<|endoftext|>
Yo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
 That I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you, God

<|endoftext|>
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
 To be walkin' this borderline of Detroit city limits

<|endoftext|>
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
 Who must I show to bust my flow?

<|endoftext|>
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
 My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want

<|endoftext|>
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
 She retaliates by tryin’ to leave the house

<|endoftext|>
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
 We've been down this road too many times for me to count

<|endoftext|>
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
 So much so that I bet you she don't even know that she's

<|endoftext|>
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
 I know she cheats, so do I, I'm soulless, she's heartless

<|endoftext|>
That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she
 Tried to two-time me

<|endoftext|>
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
 Who the fuck's Milo?

<|endoftext|>
And follow you while you drive home
 But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown

<|endoftext|>
You recognized me and had Milo flip me off
 Right out the passenger side window (*Beep-Beep*)

<|endoftext|>
Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself
 Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go

<|endoftext|>
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
 Never take back what you say

<|endoftext|>
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
 Ready to scrap asap

<|endoftext|>
Rap is my shiv
 But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will

<|endoftext|>
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
 How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt

<|endoftext|>
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
 Ready to face any challenge, waitin'

<|endoftext|>
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
 Look what I have built, reputation is validation

<|endoftext|>
You're a legend is makin' an allegation
 I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with

<|endoftext|>
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
 I'm crazy, oh, so crazy

<|endoftext|>
Why am I here? Am I just wastin' my time?
 But then I see my baby

<|endoftext|>
Inside it drives me crazy
 My insecurities could eat me alive

<|endoftext|>
But then I see my baby
 Suddenly I'm not crazy

<|endoftext|>
My soul and just know that I grow colder the older I grow
 This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold

<|endoftext|>
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
 But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt

<|endoftext|>
I got my baby, maybe, the only lady that I adore
 Hailie! So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya

<|endoftext|>
Probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
 Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it

<|endoftext|>
I'm still coppin' a feel
 Like Bill Cosby at will, poppin' a pill

<|endoftext|>
While I do it pizzicato
 Ivanka, stiff-arm her while I'm hittin' on Melania

<|endoftext|>
Goin' ham at candy yam
 On nanny cam, I'm gettin' handies with the zanny Xannys

<|endoftext|>
In the Caddy armrest, I'm imaginin' objects
 So I'm battin' cobwebs from a daddy longleg

<|endoftext|>
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
 I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic

<|endoftext|>
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
 Twice her age and I'm actin' half it (Ha-ha)

<|endoftext|>
And nobody's close so don't compare
 They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here

<|endoftext|>
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
 But I made strides with these rape lines

<|endoftext|>
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
 Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes

<|endoftext|>
When I pull 'em like (What?) sleigh rides
 Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times

<|endoftext|>
To make it on Dateline
 I came to stake my claim like a canine

<|endoftext|>
I've been makin' wedding plans all day
 You might also like Eight-year-old with the wordplay

<|endoftext|>
But I'm so cold when I'm droppin' knowledge
 My degrees is the same as I got in college (Zero)

<|endoftext|>
Blow me, told you I'm so dirty, homie, you can throw me
 In some holy water, with some floaties on

<|endoftext|>
And get the soap and try to get the Pope to hold me
 While you hose me off and, nope, I won't be washed

<|endoftext|>
Angry and take it out on the neighbors' hedges
 Like this is how I'll cut your face up, bitches, with these hedge-trimmin' scissors with razor edges

<|endoftext|>
I look like a frickin' wuss, a pussy
 This kid just took my stick of licorice

<|endoftext|>
Locked in my room, yeah, but I got some plans, momma
 These damn rhymes are fallin' out of my pants pocket, I can't stop it!

<|endoftext|>
I'm nice, y'all, fuck it, I'm out cold, now everywhere I go
 They scream out, "Go!", I'm 'bout to clean house, yo

<|endoftext|>
'Til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's
 A stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah

<|endoftext|>
This hip-hop shit in his hip pocket, and still the shit got
 That white-trash traffic in gridlock, shit hoppin' like six blocks

<|endoftext|>
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great, big scene
 And don't treat me like I'm Pee-wee Herman, this movie's PG

<|endoftext|>
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
 I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free

<|endoftext|>
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
 Nobody is safe from me, no, not even me

<|endoftext|>
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit
 Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid

<|endoftext|>
Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
 Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, "Fuck it"

<|endoftext|>
And balance it with talents, wit
 'Cause life is like a penny (Life is like a penny)

<|endoftext|>
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
 Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle

<|endoftext|>
You might also like Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (Yeah)
 I was getting my ass beat twice a week (What?)

<|endoftext|>
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
 Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed

<|endoftext|>
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
 But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get

<|endoftext|>
Ain't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss
 You're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed

<|endoftext|>
I forgot, what'd you say it was? Damn, a nigga buzzed (Fucked up)
 Hangin' in the club with my nephew Eminem (What's up, Slim?) What up, Cuz? (What up, Snoop?)

<|endoftext|>
Back up in the heezy, baby
 He's Shady (He's so crazy!) (Ha-ha-ha)

<|endoftext|>
Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
 Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night

<|endoftext|>
And everything's spinnin', you're beginnin' to think women
 Are swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink, then in

<|endoftext|>
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
 Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you

<|endoftext|>
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
 Looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it

<|endoftext|>
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
 And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it

<|endoftext|>
I've got no game, and every face looks the same
 They've got no name, so I don't need game to play

<|endoftext|>
Yes, this beat’s takin' me back to my D12 days
 When we hit the club to go and hell-raise

<|endoftext|>
Stripper walk by, I'm like "Goddamn"
 She's like "That's harassment," I'm like "Yeah, and?" (Woo)

<|endoftext|>
Holy Toledo, it's Miss Ohio
 That’s the best ass I’ve seen in a while

<|endoftext|>
Had her like, "Oh my God
 My whole iPod's filled with your songs, I mow my lawn to 'em"

<|endoftext|>
She said, "Cool, gotta run out to my Cadillac though
 And I'll be like Fat Joe, and bring the lean back"

<|endoftext|>
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
 Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches

<|endoftext|>
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
 They make it all up, there's no such thing

<|endoftext|>
And I don't mean "rap" as in a new case
 Of child molestation accusations

<|endoftext|>
For real, think my toilet's talkin'
 I spilled like, like forty bottles

<|endoftext|>
When I'm strapped, when I spit rapid, like a ratchet
 A halfwit, I'll aim at, then I'll

<|endoftext|>
Then he said kill emcees
 Trippie Redd, with pills and lean

<|endoftext|>
Sipping meds in the limousine
 Getting head, guillotine

<|endoftext|>
Rollin' with at least three choppers, Ryan is that
 I literally keep three shottas

<|endoftext|>
To store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin'
 Distorted, twisted, this isn't no storybook ending

<|endoftext|>
Fuck your worms, you never seen such a sick puppy
 Fuck it, a sick duck, I want my duck sicked, mummy

<|endoftext|>
'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
 "So long," 'til then I'll drop the fuckin' bombs

<|endoftext|>
I decided to strike back, and flatten every tire on the bike rack
 My first day in Junior High, this kid said

<|endoftext|>
So every day he'd shove me in the lockers
 One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'

<|endoftext|>
Feeling kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's "Freaky Tales" (Biatch!)
 Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking

<|endoftext|>
And envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
 I know this is risky thinking but I wanna stick her like she's decals

<|endoftext|>
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
 She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare

<|endoftext|>
Coronavirus in effect tonight
 Antiseptics on deck, I got every type (Yeah)

<|endoftext|>
And my thoughts are like nines cocked (Chk-chk)
 Every line's obscene, pervertedest mind, got the dirtiest rhyme stocked

<|endoftext|>
Plus, the potty mouth, I'm not about to wash it out
 The filthiest, so all this talk about I'm washed up, how preposterous

<|endoftext|>
Made it out the trailer, then I made a vow to cater to no one
 So hate, I've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account

<|endoftext|>
I think they're gunnin' for me, it's startin' to feel like that
 Like I'm marked, 'cause when I rap, it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit

<|endoftext|>
But odds like that, with these thoughts I have's like a giant getting squashed by ants
 If this is the test of time, I'd pass with flying colors

<|endoftext|>
Sanitizers of all types, brands, cost nine bands
 Which is a small price for Lysol wipes and

<|endoftext|>
If my palms brush across my pants, I wash my hands I sit in silence in candlelit environments
 Sipping Wild Irish while getting violent

<|endoftext|>
Homicidal visions when I'm spitting like this
 But really I'm just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes

<|endoftext|>
Which is really childish and silly, but I'm really like this
 I'm giving nightmares to Billie Eilish, I'm Diddy's side bitch So 'til the E-N-D, since EPMD

<|endoftext|>
It's like a binge, Vicodin, I would liken to tin
 My mind is a recycling bin

<|endoftext|>
Even when I'm rappin' less stellar
 It's sour grapes, I still whine, I'm the best seller (Cellar)

<|endoftext|>
Like a trey deuce, spray you as these shots penetrate through Dre's booth
 And go straight through your grapefruit, no escape route

<|endoftext|>
So you'd be a fitted (Yeah), so don't act like you fittin' to snap
 Bitch, I'll pee (P) on your head like a Phillies hat (Haha)

<|endoftext|>
No stoppin' me, you're on a window shopping spree
 Bitch, you probably go broke at the Dollar Tree

<|endoftext|>
So he's like my competition, I mean, right?
 Nope! Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba

<|endoftext|>
I'm like a sleepin' giant, and when I awake I'm like Dre
 I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey

<|endoftext|>
Okay, I'm still alive, — "So am I too!
 You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to

<|endoftext|>
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!"
 I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica

<|endoftext|>
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
 With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak

<|endoftext|>
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand, take his hands and cup 'em
 Spit a rhyme to freeze a clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em

<|endoftext|>
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
 You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes

<|endoftext|>
In the sky, keep 'em up, time to bring the place alive
 Thanks for bein' patient, I won't make no more mistakes, shit, my

<|endoftext|>
Lately, I really
 Feel like I'm rollin' for delf like Philly

<|endoftext|>
Is I'm complainin' but life keeps on complicatin', and
 I'm debatin' on leavin' this world this evenin'

<|endoftext|>
Even my girls can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it
 But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty

<|endoftext|>
Dilly-dallyin' 'round with the idea
 Of endin' this shit right here, I'm hatin' my reflection

<|endoftext|>
We just could never get it together, hey
 Wish there was a better way for me to say it

<|endoftext|>
When it rains, guess it pours — yes, it does
 Wish there wasn't any pain, but I can't pretend there ain't

<|endoftext|>
I ain't placin' any blame
 I ain't pointin' fingers, Heaven knows I've never been a saint

<|endoftext|>
A punk'll jump up to get him a beat down
 At least sound, I sound like these clowns, like he sound

<|endoftext|>
My flow all over the place, four-four in the waist, I'm so, so innovative
 Po-po in the way, I'll roll over 'em and make bacon

<|endoftext|>
I break free like Chesimard
 Keep 'em guessin' hard while broads say my bars is like ASMR

<|endoftext|>
I just adapt to the climate, I treat it like my Levi's
 When they ain't buttoned up right, I adjust on the fly

<|endoftext|>
And dive in a pile of Tylenol, you're like a vagina problem
 To a diabolical gynecologist tryna ball a fist, I will

<|endoftext|>
Fuck you, just buy me, double timing the rhyming
 I leave you stymied, that's why they still vilify me like Bill O'Reilly

<|endoftext|>
She barely was three months pregnant
 Bitch had it, gave me a baby, we named it Machine Gun Kelly

<|endoftext|>
DJ Polo, Tony D, ODB, Moe Dee, Run-DMC
 Ed O.G. , and EPMD, D.O.C., Ice-T, Evil Dee

<|endoftext|>
King Tee, UTFO, and Schoolly D, PE, and BDP
 YZ and Chi-Ali, Rakim and Eric B., they were like my therapy

<|endoftext|>
All these people I had to leave in limbo
 I'm back now, I've come to release this info

<|endoftext|>
You might not like, this white hot light
 That I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt

<|endoftext|>
Oh no, I won't leave no stone unturned
 Oh no, I won't leave, won't go nowhere

<|endoftext|>
Do-si-do, oh, yo, ho, hello there!
 Oh yeah, don't think I won't go there

<|endoftext|>
Inside a package, wrapped in Saran Wrap wrappin'
 Open the plastic and then you stand back, gaspin'

<|endoftext|>
I'm 28, they gon' take you 'fore they take me
 Crazy insane or insane crazy?

<|endoftext|>
When I say, "Hussein," you say, "Shady"
 My views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait

<|endoftext|>
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free
 Yeah, buddy, laugh! It's funny, I have the money

<|endoftext|>
We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
 Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight

<|endoftext|>
Givin' it one more try despite it all
 You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark

<|endoftext|>
Partly yours, partly mine, but really no one's
 This is so tough, I'm gettin' choked up

<|endoftext|>
Oh fuck it, we both suck
 We broke up, got back together

<|endoftext|>
Instinctive nature to bring the anguish (Yeah)
 To the English language

<|endoftext|>
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
 Hook it inside your mouth, go—hruh

<|endoftext|>
Carin' less who I offend with this
 I'm at your neck like Pez dispense

<|endoftext|>
I will destroy shit, even as I build it
 Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison

<|endoftext|>
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
 (Like what?) Like a real thin joint it

<|endoftext|>
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City, uh
 Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me

<|endoftext|>
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
 With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan (Yeah!)

<|endoftext|>
What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
 Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up

<|endoftext|>
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
 But the muff diver must just like it rough

<|endoftext|>
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
 Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh

<|endoftext|>
Glued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG
 I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!

<|endoftext|>
Besides the fact we breathe air
 Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried

<|endoftext|>
The hatchet and patched it up
 Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack

<|endoftext|>
But it's the evil that made me
 This backstabbin', deceitful and shady (Mhm)

<|endoftext|>
'Cause right now, I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom
 I've got problems, now everybody on my block's got 'em (Duh)

<|endoftext|>
Boys like, "How Vanilla Ice gon' diss you?"
 My motto: "Fuck Lotto!"

<|endoftext|>
Yeah, they call me Rabbit, this is a turtle race
 He can't get with me, spittin' this shit wickedly

<|endoftext|>
Cadillac with a ladder rack in the back, with a cracked axel, a backpack full of Paxil
 A black satchel, a knapsack and a flask full of 'gnac and Jack Daniels

<|endoftext|>
So many side chicks, can't decide which to slide with and which should I ditch
 So when it comes to ass, bitch, I get behind like the Heimlich (Get behind, yeah)

<|endoftext|>
Had one chick who liked to flip sometimes on some switchin' sides shit
 Pushed her out the Sidekick, then I flipped the lil' white bitch off like a light switch (Bitch)

<|endoftext|>
It's okay not to like my shit
 Everything's fine, drink your wine, bitch

<|endoftext|>
And get offline, quit whinin', this is just a rhyme, bitch (Rhyme, bitch)
 But ask me, will I stick to my guns (Guns) like adhesive tape? (Adhesive tape)

<|endoftext|>
Does Bill Cosby sedate once he treats to cheesecake and a decent steak? (Huh?)
 You think gettin' rid of me's a piece of cake?

<|endoftext|>
I'm harder than findin' Harvey Weinstein a date (Damn)
 And that's why they say I got more lines than Black Friday

<|endoftext|>
Eating pork rinds, sword fightin' in pajamas
 At the crib, playin' Fortnite with your grandma

<|endoftext|>
I went from Little Caesars, BLTses, grilled cheeses
 Bein' dirt poor to filthy rich, I'm still me, bitch

<|endoftext|>
Like a realtor, that's real tea (Realty), bitch (Real talk)
 Aftermath, bitch, whole camp's lit

<|endoftext|>
That 5-0's startin' to creep up on me like a patrol car (Woo)
 I'll be an old fart, but you don't want no part, so, bitch, don't start (Don't start)

<|endoftext|>
And any folk caught within close proximity's gettin' cold-cocked
 My enemies, I'm a chimney, give me the smoke, opps

<|endoftext|>
And R.I.P. to King Von, and it don't stop, and I know not
 What the fuck you say? I told y'all, it ain't me, it's my alter ego's fault

<|endoftext|>
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
 I put wives at risk with a knife like this

<|endoftext|>
Fuck that! Take drugs, rape sluts
 Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up

<|endoftext|>
I'm like, guidance?!
 Ain't they got the same moms and dads who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?

<|endoftext|>
My life's like kind of what my wife's like (What?)
 Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night: Ike

<|endoftext|>
They want my life in turmoil like in '03
 They want front row seats, I give 'em nosebleeds

<|endoftext|>
Widely regarded highly? Bite me, sweetheart
 I'm slightly retarded, but tonight I'm startin'

<|endoftext|>
So take a swipe at me, I'm coming straight at you
 Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers

<|endoftext|>
Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me
 I laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me

<|endoftext|>
Been rapping so long I've been killing this shit, it's easy
 Kidnapping your mom 'cause I'm still in this bitch, thievery

<|endoftext|>
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off
 All this time, me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off

<|endoftext|>
Eat pussy and have pussy lips glued to my face
 With a clit ring in my nose, than quit bringin' my flows

<|endoftext|>
I wouldn't have to go eenee-meenee-meini-mo
 Catch a homo by his toe, man, I don't know no more

<|endoftext|>
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal anymore? (Dad!) My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
 At the same time, can make you dry your eyes

<|endoftext|>
Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums
 Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once

<|endoftext|>
More pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl
 Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade

<|endoftext|>
And that's pretty much the gist of it
 Parents are pissed, but the kids love it

<|endoftext|>
9 millimeter heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
 I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

<|endoftext|>
But obviously assuming you will be
 Just thinking ahead, I’ma make it if it kills me

<|endoftext|>
While I'm tryna keep the lights on
 Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far?

<|endoftext|>
Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain
 A lot's happened in between them since I rised to this fame

<|endoftext|>
I've said your name but always tried to hide your face
 This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you, but dang

<|endoftext|>
Anyways sweetie, I better go
 I'm getting sleepy, love, Dad–shit, I don't know

<|endoftext|>
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
 Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off

<|endoftext|>
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
 Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop

<|endoftext|>
Everything except his tank top and his training bra
 Ain't he raw? Yeah, maniac, that's Shady, dawg

<|endoftext|>
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself, see?
 I only get naked when the babysitter tells me

<|endoftext|>
As I fall deeper into a manic state
 I'm a prime candidate for the gene

<|endoftext|>
To receive the drug addict trait
 Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate

<|endoftext|>
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate
 Start off with the NyQuil, like, "I think I'll just have a taste"

<|endoftext|>
Like, "yeah, that's great"
 I go to just take one and I end up like having eight

<|endoftext|>
With that kind of rationale, man, I got half a mind
 To have another half a glass of wine

<|endoftext|>
All systems ready for take off, please stand by So I take a Vicodin, splash, it hits my stomach, then (Ahhh!)
 Couple of weeks go by, it ain't even like I'm gettin' high

<|endoftext|>
And since I'm convinced that I'm an insomniac
 I need these pills to be able to sleep, so I take three naps

<|endoftext|>
Great places to hide 'em, ain't it? So you can lie to Hailie
 I'm going beddy-bye, Whitney, baby; good night, Alaina!

<|endoftext|>
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightnin'
 And frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him

<|endoftext|>
I'm snatchin' every penny, it gotta be that way, nigga, face it
 That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it

<|endoftext|>
You hidin', I make the President get a facelift
 Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets

<|endoftext|>
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on sight
 And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire

<|endoftext|>
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
 I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip

<|endoftext|>
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
 If I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Bolo

<|endoftext|>
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin' sex in my tent
 With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order

<|endoftext|>
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
 I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens

<|endoftext|>
Jesus, when does it end? Phases that I go through
 Dazed and I'm so confused

<|endoftext|>
Hey, the prodigal son, the diabolical one
 Very methodical when I slaughter them

<|endoftext|>
You might also like I cut and I slash, slice and gash, last night was a blast
 I can't quite remember when I had that

<|endoftext|>
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
 December, I think it was, I was having drinks with my cousin

<|endoftext|>
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
 The sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery, son

<|endoftext|>
I'm zonin' off of one joint, stoppin' the limo
 Hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint

<|endoftext|>
I'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches
 I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches

<|endoftext|>
While he looks like a canary with a beak
 Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet?

<|endoftext|>
America, and here's to where it all— Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
 Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya

<|endoftext|>
Against this train wreck and take a stand
 Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag

<|endoftext|>
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
 Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts

<|endoftext|>
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
 I dip through in that Six-Trey like, "Sick 'em, Dre!"

<|endoftext|>
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
 Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown

<|endoftext|>
I’m simply stating a fact
 I had Wembley Stadium packed

<|endoftext|>
That's why I rise and I shine
 Like a new day has dawned on me

<|endoftext|>
But if at times my heart it seems
 Like it's in the wrong place, it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve

<|endoftext|>
Black hoodie with a scythe, shit, I laughed in his face, spit
 Bitch gave me an extra life, like, "Take this!

<|endoftext|>
Finish writin', then record, replenish, keep writin' more
 Nothing's ridin' on it but your pride, that's all you're fightin' for

<|endoftext|>
I ain't finished, bitch, I meant "in half", oil the blades
 Nobody wants to play, they say I'm a spoiled lil' baby, but— What goes through an addict's brain besides static pain

<|endoftext|>
And Big Daddy Kane, breakbeats and words? An erratic train
 Of thought like splatter paint, scatter brain

<|endoftext|>
Hear the bassiness in my voice? Rocky's back, where my Adrian's?
 Nobody's crazy as Shady in an eighty million mile radius

 It's makin' me play hide-and-seek like Jason, I'm so hungry

She's naked, see, no privacy, but I can see she wants me
 So patient, see, I try to be, but gee, why does she taunt me?

Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep and I creep right through the front, see
 So blatantly, but silently 'cause I know that she's sound 'sleep

"Who's wakin' me so violently, and why's he on top of me?"
 "He's rapin' me," she tries to scream, "Somebody please get him off me

<|endoftext|>
He's tapin' me, he's bitin' me, he's laughin' like it's funny"
 She's scrapin' me, she's fightin' me, she's scratchin' like some dumb freak

Escapin' me, no dice, you see, I might just be Ted Bundy
 Or Satan, gee, what a sight to see, I'm dancin' in my red panties

<|endoftext|>
I'm crazy, but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
 Stay away from me 'cause I'm dancin' to quite a different drum beat Better try to stay wide awake or you might end up found dead by the lake

Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch, your soul I'ma try to take
 Pray for light of day right away, why do they try to fight today?

That's it (Yeah), so sick (Oh)
 No shit (Oh)

<|endoftext|>
Of my knife off, but your throat is slit
 'Cause I'm cutthroat to the utmost with it

I'm like a veggie, brain is turned to mush, I'm edgy
 Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie

I'm quite mellow, a white fellow
 My pee is bright yellow, I like Jell-O

Runyon Ave.'s the clique, D12's the game

<|endoftext|>
I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic crossed
 The path of Plastic Man with a drastic force

<|endoftext|>
Ya ought to know the quota of my whole workout
 I float like Noah and I don't want the boat to rover bounce Once again, it's the sinister, cynical, minister Shady

<|endoftext|>
And muffled the fumes like it was nothin', because it ain't
 Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays

His venom he spray reaches like beams of energy rays
 Menacin' stares, he glares, makin' the hairs

Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off, overdosing
 Windows opening, shutting, doors opening, closing

I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring

Six sick dreams of picnic scenes
 Two kids, sixteen, with M-16's and ten clips each

And them shits reach through six kids each
 And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?!

I'm packin' up my shit, as much shit in the car as I can fit
 And I'm just drivin' as far as I can get

 Hailie, baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty

Shady and entertaining from real life
 But this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain

Let's strip away everything and see the main reason that I
 Feel like a lame piece of shit, I sound cranky and bitter

I feel ashamed, greedy
 And lately I've been contemplating

Escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me
 It's making me crazy, what's in my—

 Crying face emoji, you say, "This is me without you"

Don't care if it's at the Ritz or Motel 6
 If I'm there with ya, rich or poor

I wouldn't have you anyways, there have been ample
 Plenty days, where I'm just in a daze and I can't pull

<|endoftext|>
I shake in convulsions, separation anxiety 'cause we may be the closest
 Yeah, baby, we hopeless, don't we make an atrocious

I thought I had it all figured out, I did
 I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim

<|endoftext|>
To catch me; the minute shit was heated, she just bailed
 I'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself

<|endoftext|>
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
 I need to slow down, try to get my feet on solid ground

<|endoftext|>
What do I say to my fans when I tell 'em I'm I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it
 For me to have this much appeal like this is sick

<|endoftext|>
This is not a game, this fame, in real life, this is sick
 "Publicity stunt" my ass, "conceal" my fuckin' dick

<|endoftext|>
It's fuckin' crazy, ‘cause all I wanted was to give Hailie
 The life I never had, instead I forced us to live alienated, so I'm sayin'

<|endoftext|>
He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is Phys Ed"
 Maybe true, 'til I told this bitch in gym class

<|endoftext|>
I started to beg, "No, please let go"
 But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll

<|endoftext|>
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
 I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple

<|endoftext|>
I'm sick, quick-witted, for every lyric spitted
 There are six critics who wait for me to slip with it

<|endoftext|>
So, quick—this dynamite stick, bury the wick
 It's gonna explode any minute, some lunatic lit it

<|endoftext|>
And it's not Nelly, do not tell me to stop yelling
 When I stop selling, I'll quit, so stop dwelling!

<|endoftext|>
I can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows
 But these cellos help just to keep me mellow

<|endoftext|>
Then expect a longer life expectancy
 I'd be a savage beast If I ain't had this

<|endoftext|>
Outlet to salvage me inside
 I'd be exploding, soaked in self-loathing

<|endoftext|>
And mourning, so I'm warning you: don't coax me
 It's silly, I’m really a sheep in wolf's clothing

<|endoftext|>
Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
 But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out

<|endoftext|>
Come izzon, what kinda fizzuckin' quizzestion is that? Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
 Slumped over bleedin'; J.F.K

<|endoftext|>
And you splattered, shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
 Spit it how I live it, live it all-way to the limit

<|endoftext|>
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it?
 See…

<|endoftext|>
And make a five-seater, I'll be damned if I feed a chick
 It ain't like me to split a piece of dry pita

<|endoftext|>
I'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
 'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown

<|endoftext|>
They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
 Are they askin' me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me?

<|endoftext|>
I don't know where it came from
 But it just stuck with us, we was always brothers

<|endoftext|>
It was like ninety degrees, I was catchin' a sunburn
 Tryin' to walk under the trees just to give me some comfort

<|endoftext|>
I'm like, "You're gonna fry," you're like, "No, I won't
 I'm black, stupid! And black people they got melatonin

<|endoftext|>
In their skin—we don't burn," meanwhile my face is glowin'
 And I feel like I'm on fire

<|endoftext|>
You might also like And this might sound a little strange but I'ma tell it
 I found that jacket that you left at my wedding

<|endoftext|>
And if I see him again I'ma punch him in the fuckin' face
 And that’s on Hailie Jade, Whitney Laine and Alaina’s name

<|endoftext|>
I'm the American Dream
 I'm the definition of white trash ballin', I'm right back on 'em

<|endoftext|>
Skip over the "huggy bear," and all the "kissy face," please
 Initiate phase three, missy, now service me

<|endoftext|>
Shawty, I'm so superb
 I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words?

<|endoftext|>
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit
 Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it! (no!)

<|endoftext|>
Soon as I'm through with the Unisom I'ma hit the snooze alarm
 Before I lose my mind, who am I gonna use it on?

<|endoftext|>
Utilizing this tool, I will execute a line
 Like what I tried to do one time in my youth when I euthanized

<|endoftext|>
My poodle in junior high, used to hide in my room and fly
 To the moon and try suicide with the glue from my school supplies

<|endoftext|>
'Cause every so often I'll visit my old stomping grounds
 And Doc's in the house, so you know the bong is out

<|endoftext|>
And for that I'm blessed, so every time I rap I curse
 And that's why press, I usually get attacked by first

<|endoftext|>
They're at my neck like motherfucking vampires
 So critics si-day I si-day the same shi-dit, I'm always degrading, little bi-ditch

<|endoftext|>
I'm si-do fed up with it, they ask me dumb shi-dit
 So I act like I'm on a kayak with my back to Niagara

<|endoftext|>
No life jacket, man, I had like six psychiatrists, scientists
 Misdiagnose me with plaque psoriasis 'cause I asked 'em, "Why is it

<|endoftext|>
My eye itches?" so they gave me some diet tips
 And Viagra with side effects, I might end up growing spiderwebs

<|endoftext|>
In my head and dying a horrifying death, on my final breath
 I will tell you, apply your lips to my dick, it's one size that fits

<|endoftext|>
You remind me of my mother
 We drive one another crazy as each other

<|endoftext|>
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it
 I ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart

<|endoftext|>
Grow balls and go to call to talk, forget what I want to say
 Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman

<|endoftext|>
Like birthday cake candles
 Hang up the phone and I shake, I think I may have made a mistake

<|endoftext|>
In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I
 You might also like And it's been a while now, but I finally realize how

<|endoftext|>
Scared to be alone, can't specifically describe it
 I just can't seem to give a reason

<|endoftext|>
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
 I mean it's time that we just split and leave the

<|endoftext|>
Games behind, your frame of mind ain't the same as mine
 I think you need to finish developing a

<|endoftext|>
She grabbed that fuckin' bat
 And swung it at my head, I barely ducked and that's

<|endoftext|>
I get lifted and spin 'til I'm half-twisted
 Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick

<|endoftext|>
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
 Mash with me again and imagine this I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat

<|endoftext|>
(You fuckin' homo!) That's what I said at my dad's funeral
 You might also like That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin' idiots still (Still)

<|endoftext|>
What rhymes with pariah?
 (I don't know) Mm, tsk, uh, LEGO? (Oh shit)

<|endoftext|>
I'm addicted to friction and mischief
 It's like your bitch's midriff, shit gets my dick stiff as a stick shift

<|endoftext|>
Dick as in Cheney, drip as in saline
 They bring my name up just to get ratings

<|endoftext|>
It's like trying to choose between Bizzy, Layzie, or Wish against Krayzie
 'Cause I got a bone to pick and Slim Shady (Slim Shady)

<|endoftext|>
So me sayin' I'm out, nice to know me
 Is like askin' me where my shin is

<|endoftext|>
I might be D to the fuckin' I-Z-Z
 Y from rappin' circles around these hoes

<|endoftext|>
There's a fuckin' circus in town, yeah, bitch, this verse finna clown, ICP
 R. Kelly sex tape, I see pee (Look)

<|endoftext|>
My shit is intense (In tents) like tipis
 You gettin' wiped like TP

<|endoftext|>
You don't like me? You can bite my little white wee-wee
 And I repeat, you can bite my little white wee-wee long as I L-I-V-E

<|endoftext|>
And ever since my pre-teens, striped Lee jeans and Grandma Nan's little black and white TV (Yeah)
 Now I'm so bougie that I stick out my pinkie every time I drink tea

<|endoftext|>
So you can eat shit, but I might be the shit
 So when I say "Eat shit," I mean me75Embed

<|endoftext|>
I'm up in a balcony in France
 I look around, I see the fans

<|endoftext|>
Or toleration for this shit
 But like medication, my dedication

<|endoftext|>
Fame was a switch, but I was grateful to trade this shit for the trailer with a hitch
 That it would make me a raving lunatic

<|endoftext|>
But I made it through my situation, I hit pay dirt
 Now I get paper like a stapler in this bitch

<|endoftext|>
Brain full of wit, dangerous, can't extinguish this English language when it's lit
 And I'm just berating you with it, it's Shady 'til I'm eighty-two

<|endoftext|>
All I ever wanted was to be an emcee
 Tediously I wrote obediently, believing in me

<|endoftext|>
EPMD must've had teachin' degrees
 Learned to defeat enemies with the ink, thinkin' of these rhymes

<|endoftext|>
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
 And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys

<|endoftext|>
If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
 Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found

<|endoftext|>
But I want it all, I'm not just talkin' awards, homie
 And the ball's in my court and it's lonely

<|endoftext|>
I'm moppin' the floors with 'em, I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on
 Droppin' the torch and it won't be long 'til this sport is O-V-

<|endoftext|>
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage, I've been patiently watchin'
 This game, pacin' these hallways, you had faith in me always

<|endoftext|>
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin' Fall Guy
 I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai

<|endoftext|>
Bitch, give me them digits, why you cringin'? Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
 Will I spend-spend even ten cents on you, since when

<|endoftext|>
Like the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin', get your brains bashed in
 So bad, you will have Kurt Cobain askin' to autograph a bloodstained napkin

<|endoftext|>
Lookin' at me like I killed Kenny, gas in the tank—yeah, still plenty
 No morals are instilled in me, so remorse, I really don't feel any

<|endoftext|>
“Shady, I don't understand your flow” — Understand my flow? Bitch, I flow
 Like Troy Polamalu's hair, boy, don't you dare try to follow or compare, boy

<|endoftext|>
It's my right to insist that he acknowledge my existence
 But he just displays complete lack of respect"

<|endoftext|>
And it's destroyin' him slowly 'cause he does not even know me
 Even though he sees me everywhere he goes

<|endoftext|>
And now he's actin' like a bully so he tries to push and pull me
 But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad

<|endoftext|>
It's no exception, it goes for every man
 But if Irv really gave a fuck about Ja like he claims he does

<|endoftext|>
(I'm Slim Shady) So come and kill me while my name's hot
 And shoot me 25 times in the same spot (Ow)

<|endoftext|>
I like birds, bees, I like people
 I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful

<|endoftext|>
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool
 The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike

<|endoftext|>
While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like
 'Cause this is how I am in real life (Mhm)

<|endoftext|>
You might also like Yo, I'll listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
 (Ahh, that shit is wack)

<|endoftext|>
Scrutinize every word, memorize every line
 I spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind

<|endoftext|>
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
 I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time

<|endoftext|>
To celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
 If it rains, let it rain, yeah, the wetter, the better

<|endoftext|>
How could we allow somethin' like this without pumpin' our fists?
 Now this is our final hour

<|endoftext|>
Try to amplify it, times it, and multiply it by six
 'Teen million people all equal at this high pitch

<|endoftext|>
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why
 'Cause I told you to fight

<|endoftext|>
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby it's AIDS (Sorry)
 He ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it (Sorry)

<|endoftext|>
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleaner's
 Bringin' me home diseases, swingin' from Obie's penis

<|endoftext|>
The fuck am I bustin' my brain fo'?
 It's just the way the game go and, oh, it takes two to tango

<|endoftext|>
No more reality flow
 I'm tryna time my album dropping with a reality show

<|endoftext|>
I'm sick right into shows, ridin' on lolos (Yeah)
 Puffin' on coco, my bitch in Manolos

<|endoftext|>
'Bout livin' in the motherfuckin' city you at?
 In the grimiest condition, I breathe in drama

<|endoftext|>
It's a hidden rhyme of the month deep in the beef
 I speak with a piece, no peace on my mind

<|endoftext|>
I'm the reason you guys won't say that line
 I'm crazy, renegade like Em and Jay-Z

<|endoftext|>
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
 I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit

<|endoftext|>
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
 'Cause I don't give a fuck like my middle finger was stuck

<|endoftext|>
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
 'Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy

<|endoftext|>
So I told 'em I was Mike D
 They was like, "Gee, I don't know, he might be"

<|endoftext|>
I told 'em, "Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert" (Oh really?)
 I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster" (Okay)

<|endoftext|>
That's my sector, homosexual dissector
 Come again, rewind selector

<|endoftext|>
Hannibal Lecter in the guy section, I bet ya
 I tantalize ya and in less than five seconds I get ya

<|endoftext|>
They say once bitten then twice shy, well lie next to the guy
 With nine ecstasy pills and five extra

<|endoftext|>
Like it's my fault his name rhymes with so many different words, jeez
 So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves

<|endoftext|>
Another day, another hotel, the inside of it is nice though, oh well
 This is my life so as I go and try on clothes for tonight's show

<|endoftext|>
To see how far that line goes, still blows my mind, show business
 Guess I'll just never get, so this shit just always feels so weird

<|endoftext|>
Childish things without even blinking, without even thinkin' about
 All the stinkin' amounts of people that seems to be reachin'

<|endoftext|>
But now it's lay me down to sleep
 And is it really my soul to keep, or have I sold it cheap?

<|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's like a nightmare
 I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a night mirror

<|endoftext|>
And I don't like how I see myself, so I open the Bible to Isaiah
 'Cause I swear to Christ there are nights when I stay up and might

<|endoftext|>
But I like stayin' feistier than a triceratops and like a dice player
 I got a nice paradise here, sealed off in my lair

<|endoftext|>
And I feel so isolated, it's nice I made it
 But it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it

<|endoftext|>
They were simpler than the rhymes of
 Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics

<|endoftext|>
Without a dime and now I'm diamond
 I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been

<|endoftext|>
Everything about it I miss, which now reminds me
 Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz

<|endoftext|>
Mile high club 'til I jеt lag
 Rothstein flow, Casino

<|endoftext|>
'Cause your pillow Brillo, ditto
 Breakin' this shit down little by little

<|endoftext|>
I ain't got time for the fuckin' pom-poms
 Shoulda never let this dog out of that kennel How many times have I got burnt and tried to act like I'm not hurt? (What?)

<|endoftext|>
Now (Now), now (Now), w— wow (Wow) look out (Out)
 Rap circles around ('Round) clowns, surround sound (Sound)

<|endoftext|>
Other words, I'm stocking caps and I'm talking facts (Fax)
 Like OfficeMax

<|endoftext|>
'Cause I'm attackin' a rapper at the phrenic nerves
 I'm a savage, back to put the dagger in the back of competitors

<|endoftext|>
Amateurs drink veteran piss
 From a Dixie cup, if you ever mix me up

<|endoftext|>
Now I got five dawgs that'd die for me like I'd die for them
 I'd fight for them, swing or shoot like I fight for Kim

<|endoftext|>
I will solemnly stand by every statement I stated
 This shit that I been through my pencil never could pencil

<|endoftext|>
Like two maniacs in the sack
 We fuck like two jackrabbits

<|endoftext|>
There's not a redeeming quality at all in me
 It's impossible, seems like an implausible dream

<|endoftext|>
Assault and demean, tossed and they're being lost in the scheme
 Squashed in between a brainwashing machine

<|endoftext|>
Prey’s decreasing, I face extinction like disc players
 Told this chick she's hot as Jada Pinkett

<|endoftext|>
Spray Febreze in the chick's hair
 Make her wheeze tryna get air

<|endoftext|>
And she'll be so afraid to leave
 That even if she ends up breaking free she'll just sit there

<|endoftext|>
'Cause I ain't tryna get in your bars like I'm waiting the club
 But if you put me in your lines, I'm takin' a cut Get a million writers inside of a room combined in it

<|endoftext|>
Try to get every idea of every possible line to spit
 Every punchline, every combination that rhymes with it

<|endoftext|>
Bitch, a whole team can't see me, there's no I's in it
 Head so big, I shot myself ten times in it

<|endoftext|>
Tryna commit suicide and it took five minutes
 And I survived this shit

<|endoftext|>
What I think in my gut instinct become in sync
 My thoughts and my stomach link up with each other

<|endoftext|>
That's basically what makes me me
 Creating stink, 'til these tats are fading ink

<|endoftext|>
'Cause it'll take LAPD and me layin' in the street
 For you to see Shady beat

<|endoftext|>
I pray please Jesus to make me decent
 Inhaling the main ingredient of pain relievers, and saline

<|endoftext|>
I take three Aleves, tryna break these fevers, I'm ailing
 I stay free of divas and ladies screamin'

<|endoftext|>
'Cause they keep schemin' on me
 Vading keepin' the women at bay

<|endoftext|>
Like Laci Peterson, baby fetuses
 Legs and feet have been weighted, chained in semen

<|endoftext|>
It's straight demon—and wait!
 Even if it takes meat cleavers to make believers

<|endoftext|>
Mistake-free schemes are enablin' me to remain deviant
 Breakbeat, eat her like steak meat

<|endoftext|>
Emcees take seats like AMC theaters
 Deranged ringleader, depraved king

<|endoftext|>
Who mainstream media hates
 Which makes things easier, still under scrutiny

<|endoftext|>
Pit with a chewed leash, and his chain-link leapin' it
 Live in the booth, shave, eat, bathe, drink, sleep in it

<|endoftext|>
R-A-P bleed the shit, still and I poop, pee it
 It's a spillage, a sewage leak, waist-deep feces

<|endoftext|>
The syllables ooze fecal, they feel like renewed leases
 'Cause my brain releases 'em Like waste excretion, it's simultaneously

<|endoftext|>
As I'm givin' these fools grief, they're feelin' the blues
 'Cause even if stealin' my shoes, thieves

<|endoftext|>
Time to shake these trees again
 Wait, make that phrase repeat again

<|endoftext|>
Killin' the loose leaf, shake these trees again
 Get the rake, but it ain't me leavin' 'em Vicodins, Nuprins, I bite them and chew them

<|endoftext|>
If they wanna license my music to entice with
 Then use the shit like it's the blueprint for ISIS recruitment Excuse me while I stare into space for a few

<|endoftext|>
The stripe Lee's, Jordache, and the white tees
 Lightning storms might be formed fast

<|endoftext|>
So I pack a Trojan so fat, when I lay it flat it's like a yoga mat
 Make a bitch think she's in aerobics class

<|endoftext|>
Careers flop, their gears lock, severe shock
 Fear at the mere thought

<|endoftext|>
That's how it go: with time spent, emotion grows
 In the beginning friends, we decided to roll

<|endoftext|>
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
 We established this way before we became mates

<|endoftext|>
I complimented her, I said, "You have very nice lips."
 With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick

<|endoftext|>
I rap-tat-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
 Attack-tack-tacking a whore with a damn hatchet

<|endoftext|>
A knapsack packed with like forty-some Xanaxes
 Shorty, come back, I'm tryna score me some lapdances

<|endoftext|>
No offense, baby girl, I don't mean any harm
 But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from

<|endoftext|>
I find the package, and I'm cool—I immediately run
 Like Speedy Gon-zales to see if I see anyone

<|endoftext|>
You motherfuckers must just not know the tick-tock, so
 Time to show you the most kick-ass flow in the cosmos

<|endoftext|>
Picasso with a pick-axe, a sick asshole
 Tic-tac-toe 'cross your six-pack with X-acto

<|endoftext|>
Spittin' at will, me and Dre have just finished splittin' a pill
 You're submittin' to skill, sittin' still

<|endoftext|>
I'm admittin' I'm beginnin' to feel like I don't think anyone's real
 Faced with a dilemma: I can be Dalai Lama

<|endoftext|>
Don't stop, I like this, it's fun, the fuckin' night's just begun
 You might also like When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like

<|endoftext|>
Isn't it safe to say this is the way it should be?
 Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms

<|endoftext|>
Keep bloggin' while I mind-boggle
 And I zone like I'm in the twilight, dog

<|endoftext|>
I'm so bad I can bitchslap a backhanded compliment
 Jackass, eat a donkey dick

<|endoftext|>
So when names come up, in that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
 And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow

<|endoftext|>
'Til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
 Let insults fly every sixty seconds that go by, so you know I meant it

<|endoftext|>
Those Pony's were used, and no size fitted
 But kissed them old days, adiós, I did it

<|endoftext|>
It's nose to the grindstone time, holmes, your mind's blown
 ‘Cause I rhyme like I'm still tryna get signed

<|endoftext|>
You had you a nice run, now take a hike
 I ever meet my match, I'ma strike that bitch first

<|endoftext|>
I'm on a streak, windshield wipers couldn't wipe
 It's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump in tonight

<|endoftext|>
I was rakin' in the dough, rollin' in green
 Had the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine

<|endoftext|>
Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleeping pill addict
 And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk

<|endoftext|>
My back has been broke and I can still walk
 You might also like I got a letter from a fan that said he's been praying for me

<|endoftext|>
And we cuss each other out, we know what it's about, shout
 Till I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house

<|endoftext|>
And plus, I can bust in that, and that's why—
 You might also like I can never understand it, that's why I don't try

<|endoftext|>
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
 Oh, why must we try? Is it really so rough

<|endoftext|>
That's why I'm actually trapped in this shoving match
 ‘Cause push keeps coming to that

<|endoftext|>
I can keep getting my ass kicked and coming back
 Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit, still mad

<|endoftext|>
Latch on a NASA shuttle flap, fuckin' snap the rudder in half
 Chuckled and laughed, utter my last rebuttal

<|endoftext|>
(Nigga, what about yo' wife?) Nigga, fuck my wife
 I'm trying to run and save my motherfucking life

<|endoftext|>
Two minutes ago, we was all joking and smiling
 This chick is clinging on to me, sobbing and sighing

<|endoftext|>
Sleeping outside the door, waiting in line still
 Trying to get inside the club to see D12 perform

<|endoftext|>
But I can't see who he's shooting it out with
 But Denaun's right behind him, squeezing his four-fifth Yo, it's Friday night, came to this bitch right

<|endoftext|>
Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes, then I plug my nose
 My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged, I know

<|endoftext|>
You might also like I'm fixated on asphyxiatin' and breakin'
 This little chick's neck like a Pixy Stick

<|endoftext|>
I'll be right back, just chill, baby, please?
 I gotta go find Dave, he's the one who gave me these

<|endoftext|>
Now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
 Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

<|endoftext|>
But they didn't want me neither, so they left me on someone else's lawn
 Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn

<|endoftext|>
Man, I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
 I can't imagine it. That little rich, poor, white bastard

<|endoftext|>
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere
 I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel

<|endoftext|>
And which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about
 They said it'd be real, I'm just spillin' it out

<|endoftext|>
There's somethin' about a white boy talkin' black
 And runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth

Anatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy
 Not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy

<|endoftext|>
Alright, listen, I need you to focus
 I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important

<|endoftext|>
Now why did they make yoo-hoo? Pippity-kaka-poo-poo
 Psych, I'm kidding, I just wanted to see if you're still listening

<|endoftext|>
I've been dying to ask, it's been itching at me, is it just because... Alright now I (Shit), I just flubbed a line
 I was going to say something extremely important

<|endoftext|>
My point is this
 That if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink

<|endoftext|>
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
 Whoopsa-that-a-fucking-daisy

<|endoftext|>
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
 Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby

<|endoftext|>
Homie, I'm the Scheiße, ask Doctor Dreson
 I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away, son

<|endoftext|>
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
 Or hide out, drive by my house and beep

<|endoftext|>
Like, now motherfucker, try now to sleep
 Lie down, fucker (Bah), try counting sheep

<|endoftext|>
And you're tryna find out why now there's beef
 Mace in your face, bitch, cry now, pussy

<|endoftext|>
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on 50
 It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin' quicker

<|endoftext|>
I'd rather see the President (Shht!) I got a secret if you can keep it between us
 I tuck two ninas under my jeans, either side of my penis

<|endoftext|>
He's a bitch, he ain't gon' hit you back, he's nothin'
 Shit, in five years we'll all be eatin' at Whitey's

<|endoftext|>
Like I'm Pac, but I'm not, enemies, Hennessey
 Actin' like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm crazy

<|endoftext|>
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
 Done seen too many real niggas ball to let these bitch niggas beat me black

<|endoftext|>
Irv lookin' like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
 Tryna play hate on my shit, man, eat a fat dick

<|endoftext|>
If it ain't about bread, what we gon' speak fo'?
 If it ain't no lead, then it ain't no beef, bro (Woo!)

<|endoftext|>
You better get a leash 'cause yo' freak ho
 Specialize in wood like she Home Depot

<|endoftext|>
It's all Polo, I'm so pro, though
 You bird-crazy; El Pollo Loco

<|endoftext|>
Talkin' about cheese and this ain't no photo
 Askin' about rings like the ho know Frodo

<|endoftext|>
Leavin' my rivals underground, like Skyzoo's, how I do
 I'll have him layin' in the street, and

<|endoftext|>
I find irony in bein' in a place
 Where I'm wearin' Gucci, mane, gettin' whiteboy wasted

<|endoftext|>
I tell a nigga: break bread or take lead
 I'm tryna get rid of this weight, like K-Fed

<|endoftext|>
I might make a little Alizé with a side of NyQuil
 And ride a motorcycle bike right through the side of my high school (Woo!)

<|endoftext|>
Flow'll have you rewindin' it four or five times
 That landmine rhyme written with porcupine line

<|endoftext|>
Them pills shoulda killed my ass (Alchemist)
 But they didn't; they just made me stronger

<|endoftext|>
It's Aftermath, bitch! And my milk glass is still half-empty
 Yeah, tempt me, Hell isn't enough

<|endoftext|>
My clique is too sick, say goodbye
 In the streets where the stakes is high, like Ruth's Chris

<|endoftext|>
I rap like committin' suicide in the booth, takin' the track with me
 Patrón's in my chromosomes

<|endoftext|>
Put your body between chalk
 I'm squeezin' the 9 iron, like I'm swingin' golf

<|endoftext|>
Yeah, laugh while you sit there thinkin' that the hard part passed
 You ain't seen pain 'til Leatherface flips mane

<|endoftext|>
Took the Elephant Man's skull, fucked it, and put it right back
 Handed my dick to Bubbles while he sucked it and licked my nut sack

<|endoftext|>
Now, when I talk about foolish pride
 I mean blacks and whites taking different sides

<|endoftext|>
Niggas, I'm still grindin' (Yeah), I still hearin' those sirens
 I'm still gettin' chased by those lights

<|endoftext|>
Only the light's lime, and my mic's on
 And my time is none, because I'm writin' more

<|endoftext|>
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Iovine time (Show 'em)
 Chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out (Show 'em)

<|endoftext|>
And I'm Stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat
 You can't sit still, it's like tryna smoke crack and go to sleep

<|endoftext|>
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap
 I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped

<|endoftext|>
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
 But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women

<|endoftext|>
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
 Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No)

<|endoftext|>
Was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
 But I still feel sad that I put her on time out

<|endoftext|>
'Cause I feel like the night won't end until I get finished
 So close the shades, makin' sure no light gets in it

<|endoftext|>
The sky's the limit tonight because the night's infinite
 A high percentage of black people and white mixed in it

<|endoftext|>
Like life's beginning
 To come out from inside your skin and quit hidin' in it

<|endoftext|>
Nothin', so chill
 Fuckin' ho, you better fuckin' hold still

<|endoftext|>
I may be a little too fast-paced and racy
 Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me

<|endoftext|>
Twenty times 'cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
 Like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing

<|endoftext|>
In the neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
 It only made me what I am today, see

<|endoftext|>
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
 You ain't gonna make or break me

<|endoftext|>
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
 You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening

<|endoftext|>
'Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day
 That we finally meet in the same place to see My flow's untouchable, now you gotta face it

<|endoftext|>
Choking a bitch, to smacking her face, from
 Stacking up bodies, to racking AKs up

<|endoftext|>
From racking up hits, to stacking them crates up
 I'm still hungry, and I'm back with a tapeworm

<|endoftext|>
Chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron
 Soon as the blade spun, vrrunn, they run away from

<|endoftext|>
Hypnotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants
 Taking lives of firemen; say goodbye, here I am again

<|endoftext|>
And it's given me wings, I believe I can fly
 While I pee on a girl, you won't catch me CSI

<|endoftext|>
Screaming, laughing
 I like to feel it coursing out

<|endoftext|>
Probably ‘cause I was on it
 Now you fucked me out of my mics twice, I let it slide

<|endoftext|>
Ray's got AK's to Dave Mays's head
 Every issue there's an eight-page Made Men spread

<|endoftext|>
This old G's 'bout to get smoked like rolled weed
 You don't know me or my motherfuckin' mother

<|endoftext|>
We'll never fold or hold back
 Just know that Benzino's wack; no matter how many times I say his name, he'll never blow, jack

<|endoftext|>
You know what to do with this
 Use it, I'm through, this is stupid

<|endoftext|>
I'm chillin' like a villain
 Like the penguin in its fuckin' igloo eating fudgesicles

<|endoftext|>
You might also like Yeah, I guess life is a bitch – ain’t it, TIP?
 And each one thinks they the shit

<|endoftext|>
My slick acapella sounds clever with the beats
 Boy, I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the street

<|endoftext|>
On open mic I bone your woman just to keep my lyrics comin' (Bitch!)
 We elevated to new heights, premeditated

<|endoftext|>
Let it be that I stated, they hate it
 Now that they see that I made it

<|endoftext|>
So I take it, that's the reason I'm hated
 To represent's my temperament

<|endoftext|>
I'm sure you're bound to agree, a sweet MC crash the spot
 I make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott

<|endoftext|>
Dethrone MCs and I'ma max alone
 Relax your dome, like a solo from a saxophone

<|endoftext|>
You right back like a magnet on my dick grabbin’ at my
 Shit, better get to the back of the line

<|endoftext|>
And at the same time put juice in mine?
 Goddammit, Slaughterhouse is signed! I’m a menace villain, my pen is sick and spillin’, my lyrics killin’

<|endoftext|>
Then I let you witness shit when it hit the ceilin’
 A nigga’s willin’ to give the listeners the sickest feelin’

<|endoftext|>
Like mixin’ some Benadryl and penicillin, then I’m fillin’ the clip
 With a written (Pow!), can you picture my pistol drillin’?

<|endoftext|>
Rockin’ his slaughter-ish documentation of lyrics
 I write with confidence, write like a columnist-slash-novelist

<|endoftext|>
Of this hip hop genre, bitch! Lyrically, I’m a cocaine Altoid (Dope)
 Ability so brain, it’s a no brain bow, boy (Fresh)

<|endoftext|>
Had a great date and we ate cake
 And then we walked and then she tried to jack me off but she lost

<|endoftext|>
’Cause she couldn’t handle my Shake Weight
 I swear, the irony of Ryan is I am bipolar while I’m rhyming

<|endoftext|>
Nah, get a stopwatch, clock my flow, hit the button on top
 Watch your jaw drop, oh-oh, dot-dot, oh, Yaowa

<|endoftext|>
I’m not your any old homeboy
 Sitting in the lab picking up a pad, I be spitting bad

<|endoftext|>
I relididax slide Pro-Dools to both
 So smooth I coast to the West like where Crooked living at?

<|endoftext|>
Swinging spaghetti like it’s heavy
 Some said he deserve an ESPY, in a Chevy like Andretti

<|endoftext|>
With murder: I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today
 We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes

<|endoftext|>
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly
 Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee to be so young and naïve

<|endoftext|>
Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, big-a-big-cock!
 Or suck a dick, and lick a dick, and eat a dick, and stick a dick in your mouth

<|endoftext|>
Wearin' visors, sunglasses, and disguises
 'Cause my split personality is havin' an identity crisis

<|endoftext|>
"Murder-murder, redrum!", brain size of a bread crumb
 Which drug will I end up dead from?

<|endoftext|>
Inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated
 "How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?"

<|endoftext|>
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?
 Bring yo bitch, I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her I lace tunes, that's out this world like space moons

<|endoftext|>
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?
 If all your shit's missing, then probably one of us broke in

 Blitzin' like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England

"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I dug it
 It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit" (Drug shit)

<|endoftext|>
I use my voice to spit the fiery frame
 Try and refrain, dying in vain

<|endoftext|>
The rigorousness, niggas, I'm serious, delirious, cause
 A curious—pause the fury calls from my jaws

<|endoftext|>
I roll like a renegade, you need clinic aid
 My technique's bizarre and ill; I scar and kill

Back in the cut and stackin' chips up like a can of Pringles
 Sometimes I feel like Pete Rose (Why?), I got so many hit singles (Yeah)

<|endoftext|>
This my admission to having violent psychotic wit
 Devour, polish it, politics

<|endoftext|>
Fuck, I'm fucking heinous, I make you fucking famous
 Them lead showers is coming, fuck is you saying? Fuck! It's fucking raining, shit! There's lightning, bitch!

<|endoftext|>
You 2000 and late, man, and Will I ain't, I'm the bad guy
 Type of guy that will drag five girls up on stage

<|endoftext|>
You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist
 Hoes be like diamonds in your chain, man, so moiss

<|endoftext|>
I write until my right arm veins sore
 Forearm feel like Thor's arm in a gang war

<|endoftext|>
I don't need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock Take off, you invited inside of the mind of
 A psychotic rhymer, I'm kind of a (Dahmer)

<|endoftext|>
I'm climbing up ladders
 I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama

<|endoftext|>
You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the West
 I'm Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart I got Jim Beam in the liver, getting head like clean clippers

<|endoftext|>
With haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
 When I throw up 16's like I drink liquor

<|endoftext|>
Shit, they think I'm Illuminati, so fucking ignorant
 Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent

<|endoftext|>
Yelling "Go Shady!", driving slower than an old lady
 In an old '89, no piece if you pay me

<|endoftext|>
Give me peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes
 I'm getting paid for these shows that I throw lately

<|endoftext|>
Same shows a year ago would have broken most of you crazies
 They call me crazy 'cause I made it

<|endoftext|>
Now, homie, who's your favorite pain in the ass? Who claims to be
 Spittin' the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed

<|endoftext|>
Blow your brains on your opposite ear and ask you how your brain sounds ( I'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light-years (Uh)
 Ahead of my mic peers (Yeah), quite scary to look at, a nightmare

<|endoftext|>
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
 I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Edeminem (Haha)

<|endoftext|>
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
 Get your mommy knocked and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped (Yeah)

<|endoftext|>
I take your life to the ninth innin'
 A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winnin'

Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun
 I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn

Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flying
 We do it to try to do without tryin' (Slaughterhouse!)

<|endoftext|>
One day I plan to be a family man, happily married
 I want to grow to be so old that I have to be carried

<|endoftext|>
'Til I'm glad to be buried, and leave this crazy world
 And have at least a half a million for my baby girl

<|endoftext|>
Damaged and scuffed, my hands have been cuffed
 But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff, or plan to give up

<|endoftext|>
'Til I'm impressed and pleased
 With my progress I won't settle for less than cheese

<|endoftext|>
But in the midst of this insanity, I found my Christianity
 Through God and there's a wish he granted me

<|endoftext|>
I quit smokin' cess to open my chest
 Life is stressful inside this cesspool

<|endoftext|>
And this is why only one of us will survive
 So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe, because My music can be slightly amusin'

<|endoftext|>
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusin'
 Tryin' to separate the truth from entertainment

<|endoftext|>
World revolvin', still evolvin', still Slim
 How many kids’ll copy? Prob'ly millions

<|endoftext|>
At a alarming rate, common denominate
 Add it up and you'll see just why I dominate

<|endoftext|>
I try to stimulate, but kids emulate
 And mimic every move you make, "Slim, you great!"

<|endoftext|>
And it's such a pleasure, every button that I touch
 I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust, but

<|endoftext|>
I'm that guy, man, shove a diamond up my hind end
 And crush it with my butt muscles while I cut vocals

<|endoftext|>
Fun I can have with a strap-on
 Stick it up Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon

<|endoftext|>
Are those pistachios? Damn, I'd like to have some
 Laying on the patio, man, rolling a fat one

<|endoftext|>
Assumin' the fact that that dude's in the back room
 Usin' the bathroom, vacuumin' a raccoon

<|endoftext|>
Shady, why do you gotta pick on the lady for?
 Why you make her read eighty-four bedtime stories to you in baby talk?

<|endoftext|>
No wonder my ass is wet, my diaper needs to be changed
 You like graffiti, dyke? Well, I can pee-pee and write your name

<|endoftext|>
And I ain't wearin' zilch, zip, zero, nothing, no, nada
 Like your father fuckin' your mother Boy, I'm the Real McCoy, you little boys can't even fill voids

<|endoftext|>
By sayin' Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the gate
 You got one foot in the grave, just stay put and behave

<|endoftext|>
Fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands
 This shit is in my hands, here's your lifespan

<|endoftext|>
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan
 Maybe I need my head inside straightened

<|endoftext|>
And hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring
 Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' a MAC

<|endoftext|>
Co-operate and we can operate and save an attack
 This bitch tried escapin' the jack (Ah!)

<|endoftext|>
And we'll be— I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
 This road is takin' me back

<|endoftext|>
I'm simply stating a fact
 I had Wembley Stadium packed

<|endoftext|>
That's why I rise and I shine
 Like a new day has dawned on me

<|endoftext|>
But if at times my heart it seems
 Like it's in the wrong place, it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve

<|endoftext|>
Yo, I'll fuckin'... (Alright), I'll...
 I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (Ew)

<|endoftext|>
With a lit match in it while I sit back and just hope it catches
 Blow you to fragments, laugh, roll you, and smoke the ashes Am I the worst because I never go to church? (Never)

<|endoftext|>
I got a cross on my chain, but it's just to rock
 Now if I pray every night (Night)

<|endoftext|>
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
 Ten blocks, untie the bitch, and I still bag her

<|endoftext|>
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
 Wicked wizardry like a sorcerer, no remorse for ya

<|endoftext|>
Slicin' up an enemy's appendages 'til he hemorrhages
 My skin itches every time a rapper recites

<|endoftext|>
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I'm for sure
 That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her

<|endoftext|>
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
 And I'm hotter than my dick is when I piss and it burns (Pssss! Ow!)

<|endoftext|>
And all that gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it
 ‘Cause your style is like dying in my sleep, I don't feel it I'm ice-grillin' you, starin' you down with a gremlin grin

<|endoftext|>
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
 I'm Slim, the "Shady" is really a fake alias

<|endoftext|>
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
 A brainiac, with a cranium packed

<|endoftext|>
Full of more uranium than a maniac Saudi Arabian
 A highly combustible head, spasmatic

<|endoftext|>
Lookin' Chinese with my knees stuck together like Siamese
 Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians (Uh)

<|endoftext|>
And pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
 "Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin', I get weeded."

<|endoftext|>
The devil's spirit's trapped inside me and I want it out
 I'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house

<|endoftext|>
With both of my wrists slit, I'm lifted up in the air
 And suspended in animation like someone's holding me there

<|endoftext|>
My skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters
 The wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters

<|endoftext|>
I ring the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother
 Covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel

<|endoftext|>
I'm givin' mad love, I'm snugglin' hugs
 Strugglin' thugs, smugglin' drugs

<|endoftext|>
And gravel in cracks to find babblin' max, gafflin' tracks
 I grapple an axe for them bafflin' acts

<|endoftext|>
So tonight I'm droppin' naughty hints
 To the finest women in the audience Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandalous

<|endoftext|>
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
 With the agility to escape a killer bee colony

<|endoftext|>
Without you addin' fuel to the fire, I'm cruel to the liar
 Who fails to recognize my reign and hail rule to the sire

<|endoftext|>
That I'm enchantin' rhythm romantically
 Freakin' vocals so frantically

<|endoftext|>
You're 'bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away
 From splittin' your shit wide open, no stitches can save

<|endoftext|>
Razors, scissors and blades make Jason say, "Isn't this great?"
 On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate

<|endoftext|>
You're frightened like, "This guy might hurt me"
 You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder

<|endoftext|>
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit
 You can just keep makin' them tired old threats

<|endoftext|>
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
 Like lightning bolts, right out the sky, go bad

<|endoftext|>
But I can never be as sick as that bitch is
 And by the way, that picture's one of my relatives You probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain

<|endoftext|>
To see why everything I say is so insane
 What's different about my brain

<|endoftext|>
That separates me from other players in this game?
 On the surface, it may seem like a scheme

<|endoftext|>
Markers, paint, inhale, faint
 Yeah, heh, heh, smells great, heh

<|endoftext|>
I might just suck nitrous all night long
 If I just die, Mike, just call my mom (911)

<|endoftext|>
I'm what you used to be, shit you was me in '92
 So everytime I write a lyric, I'mma think of you

<|endoftext|>
It starts off something like, "Shady's an insane maniac
 Yeah, Slim Shady, that's a zany name, ain't it?"

<|endoftext|>
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it, he can see his name up in lights
 Women screaming his fucking name, fainting

<|endoftext|>
Shady did it, he sold out the whole dang stadium
 Joe Shmoe made it, he took his Plain Jane lady

<|endoftext|>
And his baby Hailie out the trailer but he ain't trailing anymore
 He's ahead of the race while maintaining his innocence

<|endoftext|>
Little does he know his train is derailing
 And he's about to be raped by this game anally, now You’re operating on all cylinders, syllables spit like dillingers

<|endoftext|>
Than it's to actually make it, the game stripped me naked
 It robbed me of ever having another real relationship

<|endoftext|>
'Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
 And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat

<|endoftext|>
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
 Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders

<|endoftext|>
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
 Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter

<|endoftext|>
Polices try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given
 Addicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children

<|endoftext|>
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
 Was through that publication the same one that made me famous

<|endoftext|>
At any moment, those who know me know it
 So they probably told to go with the flow just so that

<|endoftext|>
It's a shame what people do for 10 minutes of fame
 Every day it's the same thing, people in this game

<|endoftext|>
When we rhyme with each other, in time we discovered
 That we had more in common than we thought with each other

<|endoftext|>
Ricky ticky toc, ticky ticky toc
 Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc

<|endoftext|>
You made me get a bigger attitude than eighty Kim Scotts
 And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got

<|endoftext|>
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
 I'm like toothaches: I'm painful to rappers

<|endoftext|>
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now
 Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?

<|endoftext|>
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
 Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates – BLAAAOW!

<|endoftext|>
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
 Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason

<|endoftext|>
Should be takin' my medication, it's nine to 10 I'm facin'
 Last week this old man I had to blast

<|endoftext|>
Mics get sandblasted, stab your abdomen
 With a hand-crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid

<|endoftext|>
Talkin' shit'll get you, your girl and your man blasted
 Kidnapped and slapped in a van, wrapped in Saran plastic

<|endoftext|>
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
 Drastic spread of acid heads

<|endoftext|>
Never writer's block, I block writers
 My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters

<|endoftext|>
And got drop kicked, now she screamin', "Stop it!"
 Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit

<|endoftext|>
I ain't back to play, though, they say he died in a fatal
 Car crash, shows what they know

<|endoftext|>
Homie, you got it backwards, you're dipping your soup inside your crackers
 I can carry rap till my back hurts

<|endoftext|>
I was chasing the dragon, I don't know what happened
 It's like the feeling I had when I first started rappin', I just

<|endoftext|>
They spat in my face, now I'm back to do them the same exact way
 And leave this rap game with a bad taste

Inside the depths of his basement
 I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went

<|endoftext|>
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
 I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs

<|endoftext|>
What's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
 (Chkk-chk-chk) What's my name?

<|endoftext|>
You might also like Now, I know you're feeling discouraged, but, homie, just mark my words
 I'm murderin' the flow, liquid courage, I'm finna blow

<|endoftext|>
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
 Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit' your ho

<|endoftext|>
Is like smearin' bloodstains with a paintbrush
 I can’t explain what it is my brain does

<|endoftext|>
But however it works, it's insane, it's plain nuts
 And it ain't just my brain that’s dangerous

<|endoftext|>
It’s a whole combination of things, it takes nuts
 And I’m not afraid to raise the stakes up

<|endoftext|>
Give him the surgery that he came for
 'Til I peel the paint off, I never been shot

<|endoftext|>
Man, I got everything candy-painted, candy-painted tint
 It's so dark, I'd be lyin' if I said I ain't hit at least nine of my friends

<|endoftext|>
Plus, I got so much candy paint on my rims
 Paint be flyin' off my car, be candy paintin' the neighborhood kids

<|endoftext|>
And it cum but I'm like, "What up?"
 Shut up, bitch! Sit up, get up off them knees, my candy paint's enough!

<|endoftext|>
Don't think I won't beat a bitch, I'll kick a six-year-old in the ribs
 You fuckin' retard, I'll have you suckin' farts out my seat

<|endoftext|>
Administerer of the pain, he just finished huffin' the paint
 And muffler fumes like it was nothin', because it ain't

<|endoftext|>
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
 His venom he sprays, reaches like beams of energy rays

<|endoftext|>
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical shark
 Throwing animal parts at Scarlett Johansson

<|endoftext|>
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
 With or without clothing, next to the decomposing

<|endoftext|>
Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off, overdosing
 Windows opening, shutting; doors opening, closing

<|endoftext|>
I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring
 I need a drink, I'm standing over the sink hosing

<|endoftext|>
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toesies
 Totally frozen while I close in

<|endoftext|>
In the papers, making shrines of my crimes and capers
 My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends

<|endoftext|>
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol 3 pills
 The Real Slim Shady's entered the buildin'

<|endoftext|>
There's nothing but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch
 Mildred, he's ill with it, he still shouldn't be healed

<|endoftext|>
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
 But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)

<|endoftext|>
The only problem was, my English teacher was a guy
 I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler

<|endoftext|>
While they're screaming, "Let's just be friends!"
 99 percent of my life I was lied to

<|endoftext|>
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
 I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive

<|endoftext|>
Feelin' bold, gangsta's blood runs cold
 It's time to reload this old .45 colt

<|endoftext|>
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
 I pose like a poster, he's closer than close

<|endoftext|>
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fights dirty
 But I'ma put 30 inside him and leave early

<|endoftext|>
And ain't shit changed but kept the same mind-state
 Since the third time that I failed 9th grade

<|endoftext|>
Shit, I think I might have did it when I was dancing
 While I was chopping one of my legs off when I pulled a hamstring

<|endoftext|>
And I'll be back with the sequel, repeat the cycle
 'Cause I react like the She-Hulk when I see NyQuil Into the well, baby Jessica fell, she may have wetted herself

<|endoftext|>
Quit playing, get her some help
 Mary Kay Letourneau was sending me letters from jail

<|endoftext|>
Stick his head in a blender, begin blending in G
 Where should I put the pink sissy with the fluffy hair?

<|endoftext|>
I bite into five and then I get high as a kite again
 I like it when I get in my zone on the mic again

<|endoftext|>
Who'm I kidding? I couldn't quit this shit if my life depends
 I relapsed twice after I came outta Brighton then

<|endoftext|>
Yeah, rehab's nice, I had my name up in lights again
 You see that's why I can't decipher what life I'm in

<|endoftext|>
On nights when I'm like this, no time to write this, just type it in
 If I could get my pen to slow down, what'd I write just then?

<|endoftext|>
(So who is it?) The fool who visit the playground
 With two biscuits to lay down the school district

<|endoftext|>
My man, Stan, with a gat in his hand
 Stakin' my house out in a tan, tinted sedan

<|endoftext|>
I'm givin' you all my job descrip', which is
 To piss bitches and priests off with this ("...Need Jesus!")

<|endoftext|>
Not over till we say it's finished and G-Unit Spinners
 Will keep spinnin', this is hip-hop when it's in it's

<|endoftext|>
While we have sex, while Bill Clinton plays the sax
 I sprays the facts, yeah, bring Shady on back

<|endoftext|>
I've gone mad, my comrade Dreezy automatically
 Says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that

<|endoftext|>
Shady paid me, Shady crazy, Fifty crazy rich, bitch
 Different day, nothing change, it's the same shit, trick (Uh-huh)

<|endoftext|>
Still grinding, still shining, nigga, Lord knows
 You rocking with the kid to spit sicker sick flows (Woo!)

<|endoftext|>
I smile through something foul, and watch my money pile
 I'm fucking with straight stacks, I'm kicking you straight facts

<|endoftext|>
And smoke pot till I get high and stare at shit for too long
 Like this weed is laced, ain't it? It tastes tainted

<|endoftext|>
Bibi-bay okay big-bi-bi-baby, this is Shady
 I know you was bi-bi-hoping we be-be-would just go away

<|endoftext|>
My fuckin' mind's blown
 Trying to figure out how to fight my own clone

<|endoftext|>
Rhinestones are so nice, they shine so bright
 Especially at night

<|endoftext|>
Back to the matter at hand, it's Green Lantern (Ye)
 With Elvis Presley the selfish MC

<|endoftext|>
God damn, it's all a plan devised by the Man, it's a conspiracy
 Against fake shit, and anybody who can't make hits or ain't dope lyrically

<|endoftext|>
Shady in the place to be, see
 And I got what it takes to rock the mic, right!

<|endoftext|>
That will do anything to throw dirt on my name
 If it means walkin' the whole Mediterranean?

<|endoftext|>
Is he an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian? No!
 His name's Raymond and, oh, so sorry, yo, Osorio

<|endoftext|>
But that was a long time ago when I was just Joe Shmoe
 Rappin' in Joe Blows basement, I apologized for it befo', so

<|endoftext|>
How can I swing this in English language
 If I switch to slang and turn man to mayn

<|endoftext|>
Yell "Apartheid" loud enough that he might slide
 He might find someone dumb enough who might ride

<|endoftext|>
I sense someone's tappin' into my phones, why do
 I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon?

<|endoftext|>
The FBI might be tryin' to pull my file soon
 I might be walkin' blindfold into a typhoon

<|endoftext|>
I might be seein' rockets light up the night sky
 Right outside the window of my living room

<|endoftext|>
Who hid behind the freedom of speech
 Tried to take the 5th Amendment, use it, twist it and bend it

<|endoftext|>
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him, and bit him
 He came back with 6 or 7 dudes screaming "GET HIM!"

<|endoftext|>
Well, to be honest
 The smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic

<|endoftext|>
Trying to stick my fucking dick inside a mannequin's ass
 Then I get manic-depressed, see the orthodontist, get gassed

<|endoftext|>
The medication is making my hands a little shakier
 Hand me that eighteen-month-old baby to shake him up

<|endoftext|>
It'll only take me a second to choke his trachea
 Breaking his neck in eighty-some places, baby, here Shady comes, lady

<|endoftext|>
She's missing, where is she? Something fishy is going on
 I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs

<|endoftext|>
My brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight
 But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate

<|endoftext|>
The only problem was, my English teacher was a guy
 I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler

<|endoftext|>
While they're screaming, "Let's just be friends!"
 99 percent of my life I was lied to

<|endoftext|>
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
 I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive

<|endoftext|>
'Cause, man, I live in the D, this shit ain't given for free
 Nothin' is different to me, so what else is there to see?

<|endoftext|>
It's the return of the... "ah wait, no way, you're kidding
 He didn't just say what I think he did, did he"

<|endoftext|>
All of these women love Eminem
 "Chigga chigga chigga Slim Shady, I'm sick of him

<|endoftext|>
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
 Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records

<|endoftext|>
Plus she got a sugar daddy
 Gassin' every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly

<|endoftext|>
Got to the crib, she let me in
 She didn't waste time, she grabbed my hand

<|endoftext|>
So I'ma wait for your evacuation
 'Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in

<|endoftext|>
And so, we meet again, you're actin' like an ex-wife
 All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife

<|endoftext|>
My brain’s dusted, I’m disgusted at all my habits
 Too many aspirin tablets, empty medicine cabinets

<|endoftext|>
Crews die from an overdosage of excessive flavor
 Aggressive nature got me stickin’ you for your Progressive pager

<|endoftext|>
Boostin’ Nike jackets, escaped from psychiatrics
 Told the nurse to save my bed for me, I might be back, trick

<|endoftext|>
Chasin’ dips, take ‘em on long vacation trips
 Kidnappin’ ‘em and trappin’ ‘em in abusive relationships

<|endoftext|>
Sendin' unsolicited dick pics to dimwitted thick chicks
 Was so high I lost track of my ways

<|endoftext|>
Hip hop is alive, but the rhymes died
 Only fear I have is "world star" being yelled from my blind side

<|endoftext|>
I'm outlining everybody in chalk white
 The off-beat deceased version of Dr. Narcisse

<|endoftext|>
This ain't blueprint, your idolizing
 You tryna jump fast that's foolish of you in my drunk past and handing me my pilot's license

<|endoftext|>
Best spit, make any set trip, yeah its the gang members
 Waving that shady flag, navy jag

<|endoftext|>
Matching the yank' fit, with the polo brief showing, due to the lazy sag
 I'm in a crazy kind of place

<|endoftext|>
I got this thing right on my waist that'll leave tears on your baby mommas face
 So chill, I'm in a crazy kind of place, I got this thing below my waist

<|endoftext|>
I'm out here hunting with my ink pen
 I'm living like a kingpin

<|endoftext|>
Doing it for my g's in the pen
 Dreaming about two-piecing a police chief's chin

<|endoftext|>
You rappers something candy coated, I don't like suckers
 I'm Iron Mike, I don't like Busters

<|endoftext|>
Like MC Eiht in a L.A. hat, these rappers straight tryna dodge a menace
 I'm looking at your videos, look like your watching tennis

<|endoftext|>
Family I'm amongst mine
 I keep the peace like a monks mind

<|endoftext|>
I'll never make it averaging a D+
 I need to sit on my ass and sue people like she does

<|endoftext|>
Has pushed me to the brink, "My pussy, does it stink?
 He still loves me 'cause he puts me in his ink

<|endoftext|>
This bitch really thinks she can get me
 If she still wants me, drivin' across country

<|endoftext|>
You cunnin' little cunt, deceitful witch
 You thought you had me, 'til my shrink told me this I feel like a serial killer, I keep dumpin' bodies in the lake

<|endoftext|>
How do I know she ain't gonna kill me when I sleep?
 I shriek every time she hands me something to drink

<|endoftext|>
Not even the same league as Jay-Z, Nas, Pac
 Biggie, or maybe they'll name me somewhere down at the bottom

<|endoftext|>
And that very well maybe the same reason they don't say me
 When they speak on hip-hop legends, which has amazed me

<|endoftext|>
'Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
 And make it big—ba—big—big bay—ba—baby So maybe the eighties made me crazy

<|endoftext|>
I've been tryna get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
 Gave me the gate key, paved the way

<|endoftext|>
So lately, my stakes get better each day
 Replay my relay race, when I was chasin' the 8V at eighteen

<|endoftext|>
Eight years later, his voice in Beijing
 No choice, I chase cream, so This is what I eat, sleep and breathe and feed

<|endoftext|>
My kids wit', it fulfill all my family needs (Come on)
 I treat the mic like the block, fuck with my rocks, and squeeze

<|endoftext|>
Critics expectin' me to underachieve
 I just deal with the hate I receive by rollin' back my sleeves

<|endoftext|>
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
 And tell him "Suck my dick," take a bow and I leave (Woo)

<|endoftext|>
I take life through the pen, by the way, I'ma see (Uh, oh, ha)
 Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat (Yeah, pussy)

<|endoftext|>
Cynics keep on thinkin' it's a fuckin' gimmick when it ain't
 Clinically insane, brain is on Venus, up Uranus

<|endoftext|>
Greet him with a shake, see he ain't as mean as what they say
 See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say

<|endoftext|>
Or am I truly psychotic? Or my molecules just diabolical?
 'Cause biologically, I defy logic, by golly, haul me off on a trolley

<|endoftext|>
I'm so slap happy, man, snap me back to reality
 I'm a walkin' art gallery, a science museum

<|endoftext|>
Maybe it's 'cause I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap
 While I'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques

<|endoftext|>
I'm still sick, how can I be sick this long
 And I'm still alive? Magic Johnson of rhymes

<|endoftext|>
And coulda retired at twenty-nine in my twenties still?
 And Fif' hit a lick on that Coca-Cola shit

<|endoftext|>
Woah, Nelly, tell Angelina Jolie I'm ready
 With petroleum jelly, to smear it all over me belly

<|endoftext|>
I'm Tommy Motola Mariah, don't stop me, I'm on a roll
 Oh!You might also like7Embed

<|endoftext|>
Decapitated Christina Applegate and I rap like I'm agitated
 No chill, but I'm half sedated

<|endoftext|>
A functioning addict — wait, I'm in London?
 Brains underwear? A pantywaist, classic case of disfunction

<|endoftext|>
Lack of class displayed, but such a vast array in abundance
 Of sad disgraceful and bad distasteful redundance

<|endoftext|>
And, bitch, I'm hung like candy canes if you're wonderin'
 Balls come at you like batting cages

<|endoftext|>
I'm raw like Big Daddy Kane is, I'm comin'
 Like I'm ejaculatin' and nuttin'

<|endoftext|>
I'm back like I'm in the bathroom takin' a dump and
 It's back in the day or somethin'

<|endoftext|>
And I will never go back to poverty, see, it ain't easy
 To try to step away from entertainment, separate it from CDs

<|endoftext|>
Holy Toledo, it’s Angelina Jolie, amigo
 She told me "Yo, Shady just hand your penis to me, I’ll deep throat,"

<|endoftext|>
Just in case I ain't dope enough with the raps, though
 Coke is cut with tobacco, smoke it up, then go wacko

<|endoftext|>
I might just scoot by and shoot my mom in the neck with rugers
 Spit in Jason's face while I vomit on Freddy Krueger

<|endoftext|>
Miraculously, she survived the attack
 Even after his accuracy after he hacked the pussy with an axe

<|endoftext|>
Let me add my two cents, of course I side with Chris Brown
 I'd beat a bitch down too if she gave my dick an itch, now

<|endoftext|>
The poster addict for post-traumatic stress
 I guess this is the most dramatic I’ve been in a while

<|endoftext|>
And I just got to get so hype when I speak in a hyper tone
 There's so many styles I might get thrown, and here's a place where I like to roam

<|endoftext|>
And all the girls that I like to bone
 Have the big butts, no they don't, 'cause I don't like that nigga shit

<|endoftext|>
Well if you send the addy, I'ma paste it in my maps
 All I ever wanted was a freak that's gon' hit me once a week You say I'm cold to the touch

<|endoftext|>
I'm been about my business since then, so anxious
 It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn

<|endoftext|>
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
 Vicious, I'm experiencing the same sights as him

<|endoftext|>
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
 Rolling, going through the same shit he spoken

<|endoftext|>
Open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
 When Ready to Die was a sick part of my life

<|endoftext|>
Palming that forty-five, plotting to pop my mind
 Then that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind

<|endoftext|>
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B.I I took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind
 Into the most phenomenal artist of any and all time

<|endoftext|>
Regardless to critics yelling that East/West
 I seen the game losing, I'm just pressing the reset

<|endoftext|>
Yo, B-Rabbit
 This silly rabbit don’t like lettuce I heard he like dicks

<|endoftext|>
I stated that in my, oh shit A'ight look
 I can see that I’m put to the test

<|endoftext|>
I'm nauseous in this place, I need some office space
 The boss is late, I wanna slap the mustache right off his face

<|endoftext|>
I'm ready to go postal, I'm so close
 I can almost feel his throat with no pulse when I choke him

<|endoftext|>
I've been protested and demonstrated against
 Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times

<|endoftext|>
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
 He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out

<|endoftext|>
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
 His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope

<|endoftext|>
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
 When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's

<|endoftext|>
And I don't know if no one knows it
 So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it

<|endoftext|>
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
 I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed

<|endoftext|>
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
 All the pain inside amplified by the

<|endoftext|>
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
 Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family

<|endoftext|>
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
 This may be the only opportunity that I got

<|endoftext|>
You faggots turn yellow like the trees in the fall
 I'm shittin' on rappers, (Where's Shady?) he's in the stall

<|endoftext|>
Timin' is everything, and it seems to be the key
 To my success, it's worked for me repeatedly

<|endoftext|>
Timin' is everything, and it seems to be the key
 To my success, it's worked for me repeatedly

<|endoftext|>
Dre's quittin', Jay's quittin', now it's just gangtas
 Just sayin' the same shit, it's ancient, it's fake and it's

<|endoftext|>
It's been a little boring lately
 I've been playing in poison ivy and pee

<|endoftext|>
I put on my best dang white tee for this evening's festivities
 And I even got it pressed and dry-cleaned

<|endoftext|>
It's me and the rest of my heathens, we in the building
 'Til it closes, we're partying 'til then nobody knows that I'm drinking

<|endoftext|>
Get the info on the nympho dudes went for 'cause of the way he pimped up
 Shady's Mercedes Benz with the crazy rims got the ladies trembling

<|endoftext|>
You're lucky I didn't just drive by in it
 You're privileged just to be inside of it

<|endoftext|>
I stepped in this party to liven it
 I just caught a vibe in it the minute that I arrived in it

<|endoftext|>
I grab her like Gnarls Barkley holds the mic, your snarls spark me
 I smile like Charles Barkley come on I'm hard, guard me

<|endoftext|>
I'm like Rasheed, I remind me the spirit of Proof
 I'm happy and lucky, ballin' and groovin', I'm on the move

<|endoftext|>
I got a friend of mine, named 50 Cent I signed
 This shit's official now, the deal is finished and it's time

<|endoftext|>
Its like a goldmine for my man to take nine
 And bounce right back, gotta be like Michael Myers

<|endoftext|>
I said in my line, I hit 'em with the nine
 I had a empty clip but they ain't check the chamber (Ha!) Damn, 50

<|endoftext|>
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
 Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa

<|endoftext|>
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
 Ain't no telling when this chokehold

<|endoftext|>
Chased it with straight liquor
 Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint

<|endoftext|>
Hi, kids! Do you like Primus? (Yeah, yeah)
 Wanna see me stick nine inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh huh!)

<|endoftext|>
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
 Try 'cid and get messed up worse than my life is?

<|endoftext|>
My brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight
 But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate

<|endoftext|>
Well, since age twelve, I felt like a caged elf
 Who stayed to himself in one space, chasing his tail

<|endoftext|>
While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends!"
 Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to

<|endoftext|>
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
 I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive

<|endoftext|>
Hi! My name is Chicka-chicka-chicka
 Chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka

<|endoftext|>
It's affecting what it does, parents become pissed at us
 Meanwhile ticket sales have just skyrocketed up

<|endoftext|>
These motherfucking rhymes that I be coming with and running with and kick you in yo motherfucking stomach with bitch
 Cause you don’t want none of it

<|endoftext|>
Yo Strech give me a break, let me catch my friggen breath
 And till` the death, bust rhymes till` there’s none left

<|endoftext|>
But, at the end of the night I’ll still be fucking your wife
 Shit, I really don’t care your style needs to switch

<|endoftext|>
You can’t drop rhymes nonstop like this
 I might twist my friggen dick up in your ear

<|endoftext|>
Ya’ll don’t understand mine
 I’m Slim Shady showing out like my tan line

<|endoftext|>
Every time the illest MC of our time
 I rhyme time and time twice but I’m nice

<|endoftext|>
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
 I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to

<|endoftext|>
And you wonder what the hell I need more Vicodin for?
 Everybody's pissin' me off; even the No Limit Tank

<|endoftext|>
Somebody dropped me on my head and I'm for sure
 That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her

<|endoftext|>
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
 And I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns (Yeah)

<|endoftext|>
And all the gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it
 'Cause your style is like dyin' in my sleep, I don't feel it (Yeah)

<|endoftext|>
One of a kind and I come with the time
 Havin' fun with the rhyme until I'm done with your mind

<|endoftext|>
Whack rapper attacker, internet hacker
 No slacker, best factor, Midwest bracket

<|endoftext|>
And ain't nothin' changed, I kept the same mind state
 Since the third time that I failed 9th grade

<|endoftext|>
Detroit, the Motown, where it goes down
 Kick the flow sound, rappers they know now

<|endoftext|>
Well, yes I can 'cause I'm Slim Shady and I'm the man Ayo
 We flex styles like a bicep

<|endoftext|>
But y'all ain't seein' Em even if I was drivin' in the BM in the PM
 With the top up and the top down, don't matter 'cause I rock now

<|endoftext|>
Any MC leave 'em with no freakin' discussion Run up in your house then I shot your wife
 Ayo Em, hold these Tylenol 3's while I rock the mic Weed lacer, ninety-seven burgundy blazer

<|endoftext|>
And you wonder what the hell I need more Vicodin for
 Everybody's pissin' me off; even the No Limit Tank

<|endoftext|>
Eminem is white, but he still my brother
 Slim Shady, known to go and smoke crack

<|endoftext|>
How many MC's bring my name up?
 The same slut said the same thing, it's freestyle

<|endoftext|>
Wait a minute where am I? I'm in a basement
 Damn, how does time fly?

<|endoftext|>
I might just O.D. by the end of tonight's show
 With the right dose I might wipe out this light pole

<|endoftext|>
Bitches get slapped up and drastic ass kicks
 Gay-bashin' fags with tire irons and ratchets

<|endoftext|>
Comin' to you live at Shade 45 Invasion
 The only radio station that plays in rotation

<|endoftext|>
And we can keep sayin' fuckin' you up
 Even till the FCC sayin' shut this dude up

<|endoftext|>
Shady in the place to be, see
 And it takes what I got to rock the mic right

<|endoftext|>
Eating bread crunchy, cement bed's comfy
 Head's lumpy, funky like a dead skunk be

<|endoftext|>
A retarded fool since I started school
 Burned the weed before I learned to read, disregarded rules

<|endoftext|>
Skip the classes to blaze the blunt ashes
 Kissing front dashes from smashing up

<|endoftext|>
Doing rush fumes in the lunch room
 Looking nervous, liquor in my thermos

<|endoftext|>
Jacking off, aiming straight for both lips when my sperm spits Set it off
 Rappers get beheaded if they soft

<|endoftext|>
And this is all freestyle, killing it
 While I'm filling it with adrenaline, rappers be feeling it

<|endoftext|>
Cause I'm, skinny like an anorexic girl headed for the exit
 Running butt naked away from just being date raped

<|endoftext|>
And I'm demented, and if I said it I meant it
 Killin' any MC cause I'm Infinite, and when it

<|endoftext|>
Came late to the last show with a different dame
 Brain ate from the last O' that I sniffed of 'caine

<|endoftext|>
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
 Burn you alive till you screaming to be extinguished

<|endoftext|>
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
 So suck my dick while I take a shit

<|endoftext|>
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
 To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action

<|endoftext|>
My rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
 I travel through your mind, and chill your spine like siren drills

<|endoftext|>
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator
 Simulator of data eliminator

<|endoftext|>
Through telekinesis, it eases you mentally
 Gently, sentimentally, instrumentally

<|endoftext|>
I'm tensed a bit, and tempted
 When I see the sins my friends commit

<|endoftext|>
Shit, if I get any higher I'ma get the East and West beefin' again
 Fly back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire A'ight, yo, yo, yo

<|endoftext|>
Lights, action, cameras flashin'
 Managers, sponsors, concerts, monster mashin'

<|endoftext|>
Flashin'
 Type who might throw his underwear in the trash like Marilyn Manson

<|endoftext|>
I can't sleep, a pain so deep, it bellows
 But these cellos help just to keep me mellow

<|endoftext|>
Attack your facility then it's back to my killin' spree
 Jigga, Nelly is cool, it's the wack ones that's killin' me

<|endoftext|>
While Clinton got head, I was in the sack with old Hillary
 The fact I'm an ill MC strapped with artillery

<|endoftext|>
Yeah, I be hitting you with rude shit
 I be rolling like crews with new whips, call it stupid

<|endoftext|>
My mind’s all clay from smelling Pine-Sol spray (What!)
 What! No, hold up, hold up, hold up (Hold up!)

<|endoftext|>
Because my gun's in ya mouth
 Penetration coming (cumming) fast

<|endoftext|>
Like my name is Janet, my titty fell out and I ain't plan it
 Yo, check this—check this out

<|endoftext|>
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
 Same reason I wrestle with mania

<|endoftext|>
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
 In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate

<|endoftext|>
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
 This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A

<|endoftext|>
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
 Risperdal, voices whisper

<|endoftext|>
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
 We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem

<|endoftext|>
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
 Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people

<|endoftext|>
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
 I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto

<|endoftext|>
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
 Other words, I Minute Maid 'em

<|endoftext|>
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
 I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla

<|endoftext|>
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
 Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter

<|endoftext|>
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
 I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable

<|endoftext|>
These fucking brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
 What is this bitch, retarded? Give me back my sixteen dollars

<|endoftext|>
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
 Whatever happened to wiling out and being violent?

<|endoftext|>
You might also like Vanilla Ice don't like me, said some shit in Vibe to spite me
 Then went and dyed his hair just like me

<|endoftext|>
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
 Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be

<|endoftext|>
Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress
 That's been eating me recently off of this chest

<|endoftext|>
‘Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it
 I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

<|endoftext|>
And spit on the beat like the drugs I was taking
 Just a bit of it

<|endoftext|>
Kim, Kim, be shady like me, I'm trying for the 4th
 Stop being a bitch, please, walking across the highway

<|endoftext|>
Playing Chicken, while brains splatter all over the road like
 "ricken, ricken", my phone's dead, now how can I call the bitch?

<|endoftext|>
I'll use the payphone, this bitch is calling my dead phone, she won't leave me alone
 Spent 75 cents on her, and she didn't answer

<|endoftext|>
I can do anything and apologize for it later as long
 As it ain't a racist tape from '88, than I'm straight of that cannot be forgave

<|endoftext|>
If I drank pee for, 18 years straight and ate shit every day
 On a porcelain plate that was shaped like a toilet with a fork and steak, knife

<|endoftext|>
For the rest of my life and had to watch my ex-wife get fucked by Vanilla Ice
 Twice a day, cause I said N-I-G-G-A, when I was a teenager

<|endoftext|>
Who wanna see me on this mothafuckin' mixing board?
 Who wanna see me on a mothafuckin' diction lore?

<|endoftext|>
And I'll be kicking towards to mothafuckin' camera looking right in it
 I can kick twenty dope rhymes in one minute

<|endoftext|>
And we'll be— I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
 This road is takin' me back

<|endoftext|>
I'm simply stating a fact
 I had Wembley Stadium packed

<|endoftext|>
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
 I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me

<|endoftext|>
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado
 The hell if I know

<|endoftext|>
Do I want leather seats or vinyl
 Decisions, decisions garage looks like precision collision

<|endoftext|>
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
 Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk

<|endoftext|>
He made it, but this was j-j-just not the way this
 Was supposed to go, I'm afraid to say this, but—You might also like5Embed

<|endoftext|>
And I would like to introduce myse-self, surprise! Hi, it's Ike
 'bout to get my Ike on I come with a life supply of wife beaters

<|endoftext|>
And my Nikes on and a white tee over that iron mic
 Lookin' fly tonight, feel like I might die from a spider bite

<|endoftext|>
So cold to dykes, the chance is snow in San Francisco
 Boy I'm from Detroit city, you live in animosity

<|endoftext|>
I got a sci-fi plot like a science fiction flick that I'm a hit you wit'
 I got the Outsidaz up in this bitch

<|endoftext|>
I hid a secret message inside of a word search
 Wit' smeared letters, runnin' together in blurred spurts

<|endoftext|>
Aha-ah, pimpin' seh me is di World Boss
 Every liquor in di building we drink and floss off

<|endoftext|>
The Devil's spirit's trapped inside me and I want it out
 I'm on the couch, bleeding to death in a haunted house

<|endoftext|>
With both of my wrists slit, I'm lifted up in the air
 And suspended in animation like someone's holding me there

<|endoftext|>
My skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters
 The wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters

<|endoftext|>
I ring the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother
 Covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel

<|endoftext|>
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
 (What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?)

<|endoftext|>
Alright, Shady, maybe he's right Grady
 But think about the baby before you get all crazy

<|endoftext|>
This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip-hop
 You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match

<|endoftext|>
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
 Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack

<|endoftext|>
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
 It's actually disastrously bad for the wack

<|endoftext|>
It's me, my honesty's brutal
 But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though

<|endoftext|>
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
 So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine

<|endoftext|>
Man, oh, man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
 So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day

<|endoftext|>
Never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting
 For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating

<|endoftext|>
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
 I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel, I'ma sleep in the front seat

<|endoftext|>
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
 But in my head, there's something I can feel tugging and struggling

<|endoftext|>
I'd never let another chick bring me down, in a relationship
 Save it bitch, babysit, you make me sick

<|endoftext|>
Play no games, say no names, ever since I broke up with what's her face
 I'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask

<|endoftext|>
Puss blew out, poppin' shit, wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
 Am I too nice, buy you ice, bitch if you died, I wouldn't buy you life

<|endoftext|>
What you tryin' to be my new wife, what you Mariah, fly through twice... Don't get me wrong, I love these ho's
 It's no secret, everybody knows

<|endoftext|>
First off you don't know Marshall, at all so don't grow partial
 That's ammo for my arsenal, I'll slap you off that barstool

<|endoftext|>
Yo, I need a frickin' kleenex, so I die like River Phoenix
 When I'm chillin with Phoneix, with two Coronas

<|endoftext|>
But, yo still, Slim Shady gets ill with the skill
 And I'm a always bill and kill, my baby's mama

<|endoftext|>
Suddenly my wrists tried to slit me
 Couldn't believe it, yo, ya'll can't conceive it

<|endoftext|>
Yo, y'all keep it a secret
 I'm top secret, like pop secret

<|endoftext|>
Well, I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled
 Then pop the same shit that got **** killed

<|endoftext|>
Then I'ma vanish from the face of the planet and come back
 Speaking so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it

<|endoftext|>
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
 He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out

<|endoftext|>
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
 There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad, but he won't

<|endoftext|>
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
 His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope

<|endoftext|>
He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
 When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's

<|endoftext|>
Back to the lab again, yo! This whole rhapsody
 Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping

<|endoftext|>
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
 These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows

<|endoftext|>
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
 God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father

<|endoftext|>
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
 But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water

<|endoftext|>
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
 They moved on to the next schmoe who flows

<|endoftext|>
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
 I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed

<|endoftext|>
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
 All the pain inside amplified by the

<|endoftext|>
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
 Five, and I can't provide the right type of life for my family

<|endoftext|>
So here I go, it's my shot, feet: fail me not
 This may be the only opportunity that I got

<|endoftext|>
I lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze
 Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening

<|endoftext|>
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
 As pressure increases like khakis

<|endoftext|>
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
 'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart

<|endoftext|>
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
 Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan I can't tell you what it really is

<|endoftext|>
I can only tell you what it feels like
 And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe

<|endoftext|>
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
 As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight

<|endoftext|>
Alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
 But think about the baby before you get all crazy

<|endoftext|>
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
 I'm an M-80, you little like that Kim lady

<|endoftext|>
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
 I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smoking dope then

<|endoftext|>
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
 Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview

<|endoftext|>
You might also like Somebody let me out this limousine! I'm a caged demon
 On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine

<|endoftext|>
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
 I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches

<|endoftext|>
Sick of nagging bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
 In school I never said much, too busy having a headrush

<|endoftext|>
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
 Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed

<|endoftext|>
Went to gym in 8th grade, raped the women's swim team
 Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian

<|endoftext|>
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
 ‘Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill

<|endoftext|>
Killed them both then smeared blood on the white Bronco
 My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk

<|endoftext|>
Distorted, ordered by the court to be aborted
 Snorted, right before these vocals were recorded

<|endoftext|>
Deserted, abandoned by my mama and it hurted
 The worst nut my daddy ever squirted

<|endoftext|>
Yo, I'm in a 'Vette breakin' necks
 Cashin' checks, whiplashin' necks, smashin' decks

<|endoftext|>
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
 Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind

<|endoftext|>
And I don't know if no one knows it
 So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it

<|endoftext|>
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
 Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try

<|endoftext|>
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
 I maybe made some mistakes

<|endoftext|>
Victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
 My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't

<|endoftext|>
They keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best
 Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it

<|endoftext|>
Maybe it's because I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap
 While I'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques

<|endoftext|>
I'm still sick, how can I be sick this long?
 And I'm still alive, Magic Johnson of rhymes

<|endoftext|>
I thrive on makin' my opponents think that I've died
 That's when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there

<|endoftext|>
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25
 And coulda retired at 29 in my 20's still?

<|endoftext|>
I was rakin' in the dough, rollin' in green
 Had the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine

<|endoftext|>
Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleeping pill addict
 And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk

<|endoftext|>
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
 Just watching it from a opposite standpoint

<|endoftext|>
Oldest, dopest, grossest flow
 Killer, father, loving home

<|endoftext|>
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him, and bit him
 He came back with six or seven dudes screaming "Get him!"

<|endoftext|>
While I set in wit' the grind, give me credit when it's mine
 Boy, I dead it like a nine millimeter, see the sign and the heater

<|endoftext|>
See the way I make 'em bug, motherfucker, don't no (Love)
 You might also like I'm alive again, more alive than I have been

<|endoftext|>
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
 It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump

<|endoftext|>
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (Uh)
 That means I'm on top of my game

<|endoftext|>
And I might snap, one day just like that
 I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack

<|endoftext|>
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands
 The shit is in my hands, here's yo' lifespan

<|endoftext|>
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan
 Maybe I need my head inside straightened

<|endoftext|>
And have the lady at the desk bring
 Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin the Mac

<|endoftext|>
Cooperate, and we can operate, and save an attack
 This bitch tried escapin the jack

<|endoftext|>
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
 I'll be one tough act to follow

<|endoftext|>
So the FCC won't let me be
 Or let me be me, so let me see

<|endoftext|>
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
 And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe

<|endoftext|>
So this must mean I'm disgusting
 But it's just me, I'm just obscene

<|endoftext|>
There's a concept that works
 20,000,000 other white rappers emerge

<|endoftext|>
But no matter how many fish in the sea
 It'd be so empty without me

<|endoftext|>
You might also like Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
 And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink

Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little chicken's earlobe
 Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old

<|endoftext|>
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his ****?
 Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady

<|endoftext|>
In a relationship; save it, trick
 Babysit? You make me sick

<|endoftext|>
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
 Kiss my lips? Chick, why ask?

<|endoftext|>
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
 Trick, if you died, wouldn't buy you life

<|endoftext|>
What you tryin' to be, my new wife?
 What you, Mariah? Fly through twice

<|endoftext|>
Come on, relax guy, I like gay men
 Right, Ken? Give me an amen! (A-men!)

<|endoftext|>
"Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
 Heal this child, help us destroy these demons

<|endoftext|>
You can't teach me a goddamn thing cause
 I watch TV and Comcast cable

<|endoftext|>
I'm tired of backstabbin'-*** snakes with friendly grins
 I'm tired of committin' so many sins

<|endoftext|>
Some people only see that I'm white, ignoring skill
 Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill

<|endoftext|>
Did 'em both and smeared blood on a white Bronco
 My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk

<|endoftext|>
No, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
 I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit

<|endoftext|>
You want to get high? Here, bitch, just sniff this! I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
 That's why I write songs where I die at the end

<|endoftext|>
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
 I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage (Ohh)

<|endoftext|>
You might also like Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit

<|endoftext|>
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
 ‘Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
 I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady

<|endoftext|>
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
 Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview

<|endoftext|>
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
 I'm convinced I'm a fiend

<|endoftext|>
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
 Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes

<|endoftext|>
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
 Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team

<|endoftext|>
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
 Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening

<|endoftext|>
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
 As pressure increases like khakis

<|endoftext|>
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
 Like, "This shit is garbage!"

<|endoftext|>
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
 A flawed human, I guess

<|endoftext|>
I'm so much like my father, you would think that I knew him
 I keep pacin' this room, Valium, then chase it with booze

<|endoftext|>
But it's almost as though I don't hear no sound
 I should get ready for the show now

<|endoftext|>
But it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact
 Then something told me relax

<|endoftext|>
With no prior convictions, so law says sky's the limit
 So my supply's infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier

<|endoftext|>
'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference
 (Hello, darkness, my old friend)

<|endoftext|>
It's the return of the "Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
 He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"

<|endoftext|>
Feminist women love Eminem
 "Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him

<|endoftext|>
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
 You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match

<|endoftext|>
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
 Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack

<|endoftext|>
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
 I'll still be able to break a motherfuppin' table

<|endoftext|>
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
 It's actually disastrously bad for the wack

<|endoftext|>
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
 "Oy vey, that boy's guay!"—that's all they say, lookin' boy

<|endoftext|>
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
 Appeal with the skin color of mine

<|endoftext|>
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
 The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"

<|endoftext|>
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
 For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating

<|endoftext|>
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
 But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling

<|endoftext|>
And ain't shit changed but kept the same mindstate
 Since the third time that I failed ninth grade

<|endoftext|>
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
 Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches

<|endoftext|>
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
 They make it all up, there's no such thing

<|endoftext|>
Socrates with a block of cheese and a dollar stuck in this soda pop machine
 Got emcees dropping to knees, copping a plea bargain they keep sobbing, like, "please stop it"

<|endoftext|>
And try to act like I can't hear
 What? Sorry dear, but I think Pam Grier just stuck a tampon in my damn ear

<|endoftext|>
Carves it across his face as he coughs
 Testing his voice is it raspy

 Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady

<|endoftext|>
I'ma get snuffed, ‘cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
 I'll pipe down when the White House gets wiped out

<|endoftext|>
Yo, I need a frickin' Kleenex
 Or I die like River Phoenix when I'm chilling with Phoenix

<|endoftext|>
But yo, still Slim Shady gets ill
 With the skill and I'ma always build and kill

<|endoftext|>
The top of the building, kill women and children
 And then it hit me, suddenly my wrist tried to slit me

<|endoftext|>
I might make a little Alizé with a side of NyQuil
 And ride a motorcycle right through the side of my high school

<|endoftext|>
But they didn't; they just made me stronger
 It's like they rebuilt my ass

<|endoftext|>
Like the Six Million Dollar Man after the crash
 It's Aftermath, bitch! And my milk glass is still half-empty

<|endoftext|>
Thinkin' that the hard part passed
 You ain't seen pain 'til Leatherface flips mane

<|endoftext|>
At a frat party, he gets bold
 And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys (C'mon!)

<|endoftext|>
I decided to strike back, and flatten every tire on the bike rack
 My first day in Junior High, this kid said

<|endoftext|>
I don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
 You can just keep makin' them tired old threats

<|endoftext|>
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
 Like lightening bolts, right out the sky, go bad

<|endoftext|>
Hi kids, do you like violence?
 Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids?

<|endoftext|>
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
 Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is?

<|endoftext|>
My brain's dead weight
 I'm trying to get my head straight

<|endoftext|>
'Cause you'll be stankin' in the back of a fuckin' Cadillac I'm a get snuffed, 'cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
 I pipe down when the White House is wiped out

<|endoftext|>
That I won't go up in the Oval Office right now
 And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down

<|endoftext|>
Shit just don't change to this day
 I'm this way, still tell that utslay itchbay

<|endoftext|>
Ucksay my icknay, 'scuse my igpay atinlay
 But uckfay, it pays

<|endoftext|>
You know, same she every nigga done in his life

<|endoftext|>
So I brought me a matic, coughin the static
 I jump nigga's call me a rabbit

<|endoftext|>
The nasty been with gasoline cans (??)
 We never bow down to be a flashin a pig (??)

<|endoftext|>
Making green like Mitch. Gift rap vocals dispatch
 With every attempt I had this game shook up

<|endoftext|>
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
 Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts

<|endoftext|>
With three spokes sticking out of my pant leg
 Eff a headache, give me a migraine, damn it, I like pain

<|endoftext|>
Like cavewomen while I'm gravedigging with Marilyn Mans' You get laced by the gun in case you try to run
 Hatred on my face by the ton, get baked by the sun

<|endoftext|>
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
 "Hi, Renée, I was just about to toss a live grenade

<|endoftext|>
In your driveway and drive away
 Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS?"

<|endoftext|>
Waging wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
 And wiped my ass with his page in Source

<|endoftext|>
I'm indoors, waiting for this acid to seep in my skin pores
 To go outdoors and do some in-stores

<|endoftext|>
Getting skully while I'm autographing
 Got my daughter laughing

<|endoftext|>
Juvenile? Same difference, I need some 'caine
 Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up to seven slain infants

<|endoftext|>
Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
 I won't stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'Embed

<|endoftext|>
Now listen to me, while you're kissing her cheek
 And smearing her lipstick, slip this in her drink

<|endoftext|>
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
 (Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old

<|endoftext|>
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
 And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone

<|endoftext|>
I'm starting to slow and these lines are my nines
 I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind

<|endoftext|>
Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none
 I even make the bitches I rape cum

<|endoftext|>
(Slim Shady...) so come and kill me while my name's hot
 And shoot me twenty-five times in the same spot (Ow!)

<|endoftext|>
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
 And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem

<|endoftext|>
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
 If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first

<|endoftext|>
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
 I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers

<|endoftext|>
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
 A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so

<|endoftext|>
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
 Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be

<|endoftext|>
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
 Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off

<|endoftext|>
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
 Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad

<|endoftext|>
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
 I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady

<|endoftext|>
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
 Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview

<|endoftext|>
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
 I'm convinced I'm a fiend

<|endoftext|>
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
 Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes

<|endoftext|>
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
 Went to gym in eighth grade, ***** the women's swim team

<|endoftext|>
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
 He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out

<|endoftext|>
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
 There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't

<|endoftext|>
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
 His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope

<|endoftext|>
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
 When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's

<|endoftext|>
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
 I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed

<|endoftext|>
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
 All the pain inside amplified by the

<|endoftext|>
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
 Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family

<|endoftext|>
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
 This may be the only opportunity that I got

<|endoftext|>
It's the return of the "Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
 He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"

<|endoftext|>
Feminist women love Eminem
 "Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him

<|endoftext|>
At a frat party, he gets bold
 And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys (C'mon!)

<|endoftext|>
T-E, ‘cause MTV was so friendly
 To me, can't wait 'til Kim sees me

<|endoftext|>
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
 And if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim

<|endoftext|>
Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed
 It's a sick world we live in these days

<|endoftext|>
Get so squinted, I'm blind from smoke in 'em, with my windows tinted
 With nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em

<|endoftext|>
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
 Thinkin' I'm sayin' this shit 'cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it (Ahh)

<|endoftext|>
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
 I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches

<|endoftext|>
Vain Vicodin, *vrin vrin vrin!*
 Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all

<|endoftext|>
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightnin'
 And frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him

<|endoftext|>
I'm snatchin' every penny, it gotta be that way, nigga, face it
 That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it

<|endoftext|>
You hidin', I make the President get a facelift
 Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets

<|endoftext|>
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on sight
 And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire

<|endoftext|>
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
 I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip

<|endoftext|>
Get the shit out of our stereo, Dilated you violated
 Now you 'bout to get annihilated, we gon' bury you

<|endoftext|>
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
 Same reason I wrestle with mania

<|endoftext|>
Pass the Courvoisi' (Hey, hey)
 In AA, with an AK, melee, finna set it likе a playdate

<|endoftext|>
Better vacatе, retreat like a vacay, mayday
 This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A, H-A, H-A

<|endoftext|>
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
 Risperdal, voices whisper

<|endoftext|>
'Cause I caught the flaps of my dollar stack
 Right off the bat like a baseball, like Kid Ink

<|endoftext|>
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Harry Carry
 'Cause every Tom and Dick and Harry

<|endoftext|>
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
 We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem

<|endoftext|>
Take it back to Fat Petes with a maxi, single
 Look at my rap sheets, what attracts these people

<|endoftext|>
Is my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle
 I stack these chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto

<|endoftext|>
Fill 'em with the venom, and eliminate 'em
 Other words, I Minute Maid 'em

<|endoftext|>
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
 I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer, be the vanilla gorilla

<|endoftext|>
Who went in me, and be on the receiving of me, what stupidity, it'd be
 Every bit of me is the epitome of a spitter

<|endoftext|>
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
 I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm un-evadable

<|endoftext|>
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
 'Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis

<|endoftext|>
Which drug will I end up dead from?
 Inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated

<|endoftext|>
"How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?"
 Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter

<|endoftext|>
Bring your bitch, I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her I lace tunes, that's out this world like space moons
 With a bunch crazed loons dismissin' brains like graze wounds

<|endoftext|>
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
 Dandruff's making my neck itch, what the fuck? Give me the check bitch

<|endoftext|>
Blitzin' like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
 I'm out the game, put the second string in

<|endoftext|>
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin (Allah, Allah)
 Delinquent, choking microphones with broken English

<|endoftext|>
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
 I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens

<|endoftext|>
Jesus, when does it end? Phases that I go through
 Dazed and I'm so confused

<|endoftext|>
Hey, the prodigal son, the diabolical one
 Very methodical when I slaughter them

<|endoftext|>
You might also like I cut and I slash, slice and gash, last night was a blast
 I can't quite remember when I had that

<|endoftext|>
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
 December, I think it was, I was having drinks with my cousin

<|endoftext|>
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
 The sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery, son

<|endoftext|>
Sometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might
 Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?

<|endoftext|>
And show these people what my level of skill's like
 But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life

<|endoftext|>
Somethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights
 Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like

<|endoftext|>
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
 He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out

<|endoftext|>
Snap back to rеality, ope there goes gravity, ope
 There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't

<|endoftext|>

 When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's

<|endoftext|>
Back to the lab again yo, this old rap shit, he
 Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping

<|endoftext|>
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
 These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows

<|endoftext|>
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
 God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father

<|endoftext|>
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
 But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water

<|endoftext|>
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
 They moved on to the next schmoe who flows

<|endoftext|>
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
 I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed

<|endoftext|>
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
 All the pain inside amplified by the

<|endoftext|>
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
 Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family

<|endoftext|>
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
 This may be the only opportunity that I got

<|endoftext|>
Catch bodies like a cold, and I stay slick so face it
 Make me chase it, I take your life and erase it

<|endoftext|>
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate
 Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin' until we break

<|endoftext|>
He's Shady (He's so crazy!), hahaha
 Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White

<|endoftext|>
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
 What if he's right? I'm just a criminal makin' a livin' off of the world's misery

<|endoftext|>
That's a stereotype, like everybody that's Black can jump
 I'm in the white mink, the fabric is done

<|endoftext|>
I travel first class, you ain't even got a TV on your plane
 You should be easy on my name 'cause I ain't going back and forth

<|endoftext|>
Your boss and your captain soft (BITCH!) 'Cause we gon' bring it to anybody who want it
 You want it, you gon' get it

<|endoftext|>
Dragged through the barrio and fucked like Kim Osorio's
 Little sorry ho ass, go ask B-Real

<|endoftext|>
Shady Records, you better believe the hype is real
 This is no joke, I don't smoke

<|endoftext|>
'Cause we gon' We gon' bring it to anybody who want it
 You want it, you gon' get it

<|endoftext|>
When I raise my knife, shit, I'm fitting to cut something
 They say I walk like Ron O'Neal, and talk like Goldie

<|endoftext|>
I hid a secret message inside of a word search
 With smeared letters, runnin' together in blurred spurts

<|endoftext|>
Yeah, no comparison, the women seem mysterious
 My lyrics work as servants, leaving listeners delirious

<|endoftext|>
Liquidating sucker rappers like a fatal disease
 That's right, I flick lives like boogers from my fingers

<|endoftext|>
My assassin has my back, smoking dope just like a gunslinger
 I'm just a merciless dog, you know the time (Huh)

<|endoftext|>
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
 "Lord, help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt

<|endoftext|>
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!"
 I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica

<|endoftext|>
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
 With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak

<|endoftext|>
Administerer of the pain, he just finished huffin' the paint
 And muffler fumes like it was nothin', because it ain't

<|endoftext|>
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
 His venom he sprays, reaches like beams of energy rays

<|endoftext|>
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical shark
 Throwing animal parts at Scarlett Johansson

<|endoftext|>
With or without clothing, next to the decomposing
 Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off, overdosing

<|endoftext|>
I need a drink, I'm standing over the sink hosing
 Myself, self-loathing, cause I'm on a brink, mostly

<|endoftext|>
I don't wanna think; this will make everything rosy
 Beverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toesies

<|endoftext|>
Totally frozen while I close in
 I'm yodelling "Ro-o-w-sie, won't you come out to pla-?"

<|endoftext|>
And no sense wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines
 In the papers, making shrines of my crimes and capers

<|endoftext|>
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
 Eighty spirits of ladies cause Shady murdered the virgins

<|endoftext|>
And still can spin, straw to gold like Rumplestilskin
 Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol 3 pills

<|endoftext|>
Mildred, he's ill with it, he still shouldn't be healed
 There's no one as sick as he, MC's will get fricassed on the grill, then..

<|endoftext|>
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
 Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches

<|endoftext|>
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
 They make it all up, there's no such thing

<|endoftext|>
Who would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
 With some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear

<|endoftext|>
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
 "I'm done with it," until I met Dre, the only one to look past

<|endoftext|>
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
 Waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat

<|endoftext|>
Watchin' me while I write this, like, "I don't like this note!"
 All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy

<|endoftext|>
So I can't in her, kcuf's like a pro
 Looks like Jenna, fack I'm gonna (hold on what's my line)

<|endoftext|>
Sorry... come again
 Things just ain't the same for Bin Laden

<|endoftext|>
This planet hates me more than Michael Jackson
 Hating on the Taliban for keeping me captive

<|endoftext|>
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
 I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to

<|endoftext|>
Drop the biscuit (I will)
 Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you

<|endoftext|>
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
 Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old

<|endoftext|>
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
 Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady

<|endoftext|>
And I don't mean "rap" as in a new case
 Of child molestation accusations

<|endoftext|>
I sat back in the chair rasping
 Barely able to breathe gasping at air grasping the bare aspirin

<|endoftext|>
Thinkin' I'm joking, dawg I'm choking
 All of y'all can kiss my bare

<|endoftext|>
Life on the streets, just tryin' survive
 Plus my niggas got mouths to feed

 A soldier stuck in these streets, hopin' it's war within

<|endoftext|>
Complimentaries and beef

<|endoftext|>
I'm like Nicole Kidman in the wind, niggas is wild, niggas is eat

Workers utilized then brutalized
 Performance scrutinized then crucified

<|endoftext|>
Barbecue wings, blings for my niggas that's true kings
 Sit up in the crib, catch somethin' and screw fiends, yeah

<|endoftext|>
The dark hallways amazingly convenient
 The phoenix with Jane, jugglin' cracks or playin' with ninas

<|endoftext|>
Bringing down the mall, I ring around the store
 Planets of the Apes, bandanas on our face

<|endoftext|>
Leave him dumb, deaf and blind, I ride on rinses
 Interest so tight, strobe lights follow my grace

The ride bumpy, who jetted out the country to buy D
 Came back, Ridin' with the gun cocked, sweatin', musty tee on

Wanna try to jump the sixth floor knives
 Baseheads, they say they take meds

<|endoftext|>
Janglin bats back in the days, I wore braids
 Runnin with solicitors, grizzlies, monkey business prisoners

No head shots, please don't shoot me in my head
 It ain't that serious, I ain't tryna die for that bread (What?!)

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
And bang in the face of my enemy
 Divine from the waist ain't no killing me, it runs in my family

<|endoftext|>
So much emotion
 Made so much devotion

<|endoftext|>
(They smile in your face)
 All the time they want to take your place

<|endoftext|>

 Smiling faces

<|endoftext|>
Third eye ain't focused
 Heavy mic, Chevy drivin'

<|endoftext|>
He in them Benz lenses
 Acting like he did ten sentences

<|endoftext|>
For all the blocks we invading, we be caking & strip naked
 I know you wasn't selling by the building, I feel the hating

<|endoftext|>
Night time is vibe, pies gеt thrown to guys
 You fuck up this money, bones is fried

<|endoftext|>
Wallies is off the meat rack, splash
 Nigga, Diamond down, moving like China Town

<|endoftext|>
“Bring the baggies, take the thousand to Nana”
 While I’m in the zone, cat daddy, indica home

<|endoftext|>
Thinkin' you fresh, suggestin' beats I should rhyme to
 At times when I'm lost I try to find you

<|endoftext|>
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
 The time we committed love, it was real good

<|endoftext|>
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
 Now she be in the burbs, lookin' rock and dressin' hippie

<|endoftext|>
Live nig's, real niggas express and taste it
 At crap games, black dames and big faces

<|endoftext|>
Awwww, don’t do it
 Cause every song you make, Joe, is really ho music

<|endoftext|>
I bit all like a monster, live nigga this is my encore
 Encore, encore, I rhyme for the commoners

<|endoftext|>
Da da man at work, I make my own lane
 I’m the franchise so I rock my own chain

<|endoftext|>
The hero that he know, that he cold
 Like when it's below in the G.O., wipe ya feet off in the Regal

<|endoftext|>
I’m king, observe the throne and the dream
 I have it, supreme like mathematics

<|endoftext|>
Chicago nights, they stay on the mind
 But I write many lives, they lay on these lines

<|endoftext|>
Wavin' signs of the times, many say the grind's on the mind
 Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wanna rhyme

<|endoftext|>
Felt the Southside venom in raw hides and denim
 Pimp minds collide with 'em, a system that tries victims

<|endoftext|>
We livin' in, my man in the fast lane pivotin'
 On the block white is selling like Eminem

<|endoftext|>
Shorties get the game but no instructions to assemblin'
 Eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dim in 'em

<|endoftext|>
Call my man Cuzo, like I'm kin to him
 He tryin' to stay straight, the streets is bendin' him It's all good in the hood, like rats in gyms

<|endoftext|>
Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go
 Though I know the dough I got to bring back to the ghetto

<|endoftext|>
Arrows on tarot cards pointin' to the grind
 Po' livin' in more prisons, pointin' to my mind, shine the light up

<|endoftext|>
It can feed a man's daughter
 I stand for the blue collar, on the side makin' a few dollars

<|endoftext|>
Hyprocrite, I'm filling out your death certificate
 Slinging bean pies and St Ide's in the same sentence

<|endoftext|>
There's a thin line between the fake and the real
 Grafted-ass nigga, I see through your "Glass Shield"

<|endoftext|>
Pretty as the skyline, the sky is my eyeline
 Son of the most so from up high I shine

<|endoftext|>
Daylight beams, night life schemes
 This is my inception, I’m writing my dreams

<|endoftext|>
Dirty to worthy, now I'm all wordy
 My broad up in Paris, looking all purty

<|endoftext|>
Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's
 Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes

<|endoftext|>
With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves
 They shoot the wrong way, 'cause they ain’t knowin' their goals

<|endoftext|>
The streets ain’t safe 'cause they ain’t knowing the code
 By the foes I was told, either focus or fold

<|endoftext|>
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
 So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls

<|endoftext|>
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll
 Down the roads where cars get broken and stole

<|endoftext|>
On the corners Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right
 Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes

<|endoftext|>
It’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
 The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like

<|endoftext|>
Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
 Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right

<|endoftext|>
G's with three stripes, seeds that need light
 Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife

<|endoftext|>
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
 Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites

<|endoftext|>
The type of bitch that B.I.G. said he would die for
 Is the type that I ride and stay alive for

<|endoftext|>
Hear Beyonce's song and she gotta perform
 Whether fucking or fighting: we getting it on I don't even say shit, she can feel it

<|endoftext|>
My ghetto housewife watch reality shows
 She might get to snapping if the cabinets ain't closed

<|endoftext|>
Pain onto my game, wanted and I'm sadistic
 They liked it, they dyked it, devices twisted

<|endoftext|>
Everyday we hustlin', tryna get them custom rims
 Law, we ain't trusting them, thick broads, we lust in them

<|endoftext|>
Inside peace mixed with beast seem to breed me
 Nobody believe, until I believe me

<|endoftext|>
Now I'm on the rise doing business with my guys
 Visions realize, music affected lives

<|endoftext|>
I see the I in We, my nigga, yours is my drama
 Standing in front of the judge with no honor

<|endoftext|>
Sometimes we find peace in beats and breaks
 Put the bang in the back so the seats can shake

<|endoftext|>
Wish I was free as Che was, I spend a day buzzed
 Trippin' off heights, wishin' for nights in different flavors

<|endoftext|>
The age of Kane and Big Daddy, short-body Caddies
 Uncles named Larry, that never really grabbed me

<|endoftext|>
Raised by niggas named Butch, Scoot or Bae-Bae
 With weight so they weigh they status on the streets

<|endoftext|>
License plates that say they, motto
 This is Chicago in the heyday

<|endoftext|>
Same nigga, same block, same shit they on
 Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome

<|endoftext|>
In my defense, yo, I had to hit that zone
 Man to man, I'm good workin' with my hands

<|endoftext|>
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
 In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads

<|endoftext|>
Doin' white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her
 In the ass, it used to be thicker

<|endoftext|>
The thin line between love and hatred
 I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life

<|endoftext|>
They say life is what you make it
 So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it

<|endoftext|>
Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine
 I know they sayin' "Damn, 'Ye snapped with this beat!"

<|endoftext|>
I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
 I guess it's messin' with my health then

<|endoftext|>
They say "life is a game," so I play hard
 Writin' for my life 'cause I'm scared of a day job

<|endoftext|>
Play my cards right, they say I went too left
 They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F

<|endoftext|>
Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights
 Now I claim "King" like Don, or Frank White

<|endoftext|>
They say my life is comparable to Christ
 The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice

<|endoftext|>
In her name though the place was his
 They tryna take everything except the kids

<|endoftext|>
All that speaking her mind, testifying and crying
 When this bitch did the crime, the queenpin

<|endoftext|>
Rest assured, we getting festive in Miami now
 Told my nigga Ye, I'm about to win the Grammys now

<|endoftext|>
Getting Johnny Cash old white folks know me now
 Standing close to the mic like I'm Kobe now

<|endoftext|>
We celebrate with shots of the hate because we got love
 It's the pop life, a lot of faces pop up

<|endoftext|>
Fly nigga, keep my feet planted
 To rock the planet, I don't stop for panic

<|endoftext|>
Kinda took me back to when I first had a dream
 To be like the king that sang Billie Jean

<|endoftext|>
Inspiration when I write, I see my daughter's eyes
 I'm the truth, across the table from corporate lies

<|endoftext|>
Immortalized by the realness I bring to it
 If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music

<|endoftext|>
My music, you either fight, fuck, or dream to it
 My life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it

<|endoftext|>
Through my shell, never knew what the divine would bring to it
 I'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions

<|endoftext|>
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
 Reality is frisking me

<|endoftext|>
I'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake shit
 You might also like Some days I take the L to gel with the real world

I stagger in the gatherin', possessed by a patter-in that be scatterin'
 Over the global, my vocals be travelin', unravelin' my abdomen

<|endoftext|>
Proceed to read and not believin' everything I'm readin'
 But my brain was bleedin', needin' feedin', and exercise

<|endoftext|>
I didn't seek the best of buys, it's a lie to textualize
 I analyze where I rest my eyes

<|endoftext|>
For your mind like one time
 If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine

<|endoftext|>
'Cause I deliver like the Sun-Times
 Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine

<|endoftext|>
I'm hype like I'm unsigned, my diet I un-swine
 Eating beef sometimes -- I try to cut back on that shit

<|endoftext|>
It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole
 They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell

<|endoftext|>
They relinquished Sense, 'cause I was guilty in a sense
 You might also like I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light

<|endoftext|>

 Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight

<|endoftext|>

 Get open like on gym nights and in fights I send rights

<|endoftext|>
Don't hook with skins my friends like, I spend nights up in dykes
 In spite, I've been indicted as a freak of all trades

<|endoftext|>
(Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo) I got it made
 I bathe in bass lines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums

<|endoftext|>
Got a shipment by the sea; see, my niggas tryna eat
 Eat whatever’s on your plate, save some for me

<|endoftext|>
We still wading in the water
 Cocaine blunts marinating in the water

 Don't talk to broads that are spoke for, that provoke war

Must want to give me skull asking me to take my hat off
 I'm ill, raps I spit as if I had a bad cough

Got my eyes on the tiger, eyes on the prize
 Eyes on the thighs, of Mary J. Blige

<|endoftext|>
She was the type to watch Oprah and the Today Show
 Be on the treadmill, uh, like OK Go

<|endoftext|>
Pathetic on his MySpace page half nekkid
 It's a shame what they do for fame and to be respected

<|endoftext|>
On the move like black slaves through the wilderness
 I write it, and still get invited to white Christmases

<|endoftext|>
Frivolous spending, drunk nights with storybook endings
 I guess it's my addiction to women

<|endoftext|>
I was in France, in to see Hennessy blending
 Writing my own scripts like I'm Tennessee Williams

<|endoftext|>
Now a storm of the brain make these guys drive slow
 Like I was 5-0, but my creed's Apollo

<|endoftext|>
On the rock and roll with the coldest live show
 For those before I came, I made the song cry for 'em

<|endoftext|>
Truth inside flow, I stand like Em did with Dido
 Crash parties, any live yo

<|endoftext|>
These record company niggas I don't like when I see 'em
 My ancestors, when I'm writing I see 'em and talk with 'em

<|endoftext|>
Niggas say I'm nice with metaphors but these are similes
 Street ministry, my poetry's a penitentiary, track is visitation

In battles, I'm warring like a G-Child
 Searching for the child in me, this style in me

<|endoftext|>
This release is like the piece that's now in me
 They tried to 'sassinate me god, like Martin on the balcony

<|endoftext|>
Lyrically I put a hit on 'em, cause I'm the style "Nitti"
 Catch a flick at the Liquid Kitty

<|endoftext|>
Trying to get a chick to kick it with me till the tilt
 Told her my chamber's like Wilt

<|endoftext|>
The concrete matrix, street organizations
 They gave violations, hood public relations

<|endoftext|>
It was the basics to get big faces
 Stay away from cases, bad broads, good graces

<|endoftext|>
Stokes? It was folks and coke and dope
 Fiends choked off of smoke, herringbones and rope

<|endoftext|>
Forties wasting on seats, Dion making the beats
 When they air it out on at the parties, we escaping the heat

<|endoftext|>
Ain't nobody stop the violence, why my city keep lying? (They keep lying)
 Niggas throw up peace signs, but everybody keep dying (They keep dying)

<|endoftext|>
Felt like every bullet hit me when they flew out each nine
 I be happy when I wake up and I have a free mind (That's fucked up)

<|endoftext|>
No food in the 'frigerator, I was banging, pulling capers—that's real shit (Real shit)
 Same niggas from Day One, boy, yeah, I'm still with (I'm still with)

<|endoftext|>
I came from a place where it's basic, but you don't make it (Nah)
 Feds building cases, judges who racist and full of hatred

<|endoftext|>
Can see I was designed to, give you power and refine you
 You fucking with me we can grind to

<|endoftext|>
I'm hot, that's why I got the fans in the stands
 Em fans googlin', enemies shakin' hands

<|endoftext|>
Restorin' the balance, detourin' the malice
 We kill you motherfuckin' mice with a mallet (uhh)

<|endoftext|>
Showing love to this lady when this nigga tried to play me
 Saw me talking to slim and started acting shady

<|endoftext|>
I hold mics while you hold spite
 Like a broken-hearted bitch

<|endoftext|>
Supposedly nice, taken for granted like life
 I write twice and drop singles in record pools

<|endoftext|>
I make my living off of singles like Latifah
 In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses

<|endoftext|>
I grab mics and murder shit
 It's wicked as Satan worshipers going to Catholic church services

<|endoftext|>
See, if I click and drag long enough, I'll get the ass
 Bring it back to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave

<|endoftext|>
Many many times from mistakes, I ran
 But I'm just a cake, let me bake, goddamn

<|endoftext|>
I pray I don't forsake my man
 And whenever I fall, on faith, I land

<|endoftext|>
Giving my enemies something new to see
 My community, they be fueling me

<|endoftext|>
Will the king of kings really rule in me?
 I'm an instrument, stay in tune with me

<|endoftext|>
Finding the losses, Heaven's excitement
 I write with a force of a kid that wanted to

<|endoftext|>
I strike like lightning and don't need thunder
 Inhale imagination and breathe wonder

<|endoftext|>
At times my going forward seems like retreat
 As I rewrite rhyme after rhyme and throw away beats

<|endoftext|>
Growing into my britches, outgrowing the streets
 There's a thin line between war and peace, whores and jeeps

<|endoftext|>
Ignore MCs like beeps, scribbling freedom on pages
 My third eye is like pink eye, seen and contagious

<|endoftext|>
Redeeming the ancients with ageless rhyme jargon
 I feel Mexican, hip hop is my garden

<|endoftext|>
My mind of flow is like motor key 20
 Youngblood said he had dimes, I prayed that he see twenty

<|endoftext|>
I can see my man was tired as he described how the bucks hit him
 And said slugs was still stuck in him, when it rained, it fucked with him

<|endoftext|>
I talk to my aunt named Mattie Lee
 And recognize the importance of family

<|endoftext|>
The price of gas rises, street life is pumpin' fast, lives is
 I watched Crash and realize that we all survivors

<|endoftext|>
My juice is grated
 Shit is so banging niggas say it's gang related

<|endoftext|>
My reason to rhyme applies to season and time
 Seizing the mind, body and regions divine

<|endoftext|>
You fake like a smile, like a hug I'm tight
 Skip ladies, this is rip a muthafucka night

<|endoftext|>
I breathe heavy like an old man, with a cold can of Old Style
 Hold a Stone Isle profile

<|endoftext|>
Home grown with no home phone
 From the city of wind nigga, win or go home

<|endoftext|>
With aggressive rhymes, I'm blessed to rhyme
 I invest in time

<|endoftext|>
Like Superman, stick out my chest and shine, I'm Yeah yeah, I'm black, I'm magical
 I ride fun facts that's actual

<|endoftext|>
What I do, I own like magic
 Status of the livest and established

<|endoftext|>
Yeah that's me I'm magical
 I'm black I'm strapped with magic bro

<|endoftext|>
Psss, I'm only buggin
 While No dug in the crates, I dug in my nose

<|endoftext|>
And picked a rhyme, any rhyme I don't have any time
 To waste, I'm hip... don't even trip

<|endoftext|>
I be rockin' raps 'til I collapse
 Niggas play my tape about as much as they do craps

<|endoftext|>
I'm on point, I cee-lo, I see high
 Hi C, I'm free at last

<|endoftext|>
I'm a free man, free as World B
 And like an early bird, I'm special

<|endoftext|>
So don't even go there, I'm comin' out of nowhere to go where
 Probably in about seven years, I won't have no hair

<|endoftext|>
I'm singing through the pain like I was Mary J
 'Cause we break up to make up like Mary Kay

<|endoftext|>
I know your young and you gotta live your life, huh
 I thought it was the right time for me to wife ya I must confess, I miss the days of you laying on my chest

<|endoftext|>
But not to be married with kids she was wishing
 Shhh, 'til your soul just listen She said daddy take me ice-skating

<|endoftext|>
To my comp I'm a ton I get amped like Watts in a riot
 My compact disc is a commodity, so buy it

<|endoftext|>
Raised by game where niggas ain't phased by fame
 Come to the crib, get banged, they take your chain

<|endoftext|>
Stay in your lane, Brokeback ain't the way of the game
 My brainstorm is like I stay in the rain

<|endoftext|>
Thick and I lasted past these rat bastards
 They try to box me in like Cassius Clay

<|endoftext|>
Hey I'm like Muhammad when he fasted
 Opposing the fascist, make cuts and got gashes

<|endoftext|>
Scratches over third eyelashes
 Punchlines are like jab hits to rappers

<|endoftext|>
Whose careers now ashes it's too many slashes
 In his name, came in the game these gun-clappers

<|endoftext|>
Cats flow is still, and they complacent with beats
 My radio station is deep, so eff 'em

<|endoftext|>
Aerial nights blew my mind out of stereotypes
 For ethereal heights, I write like Richard

<|endoftext|>
Invisible man, pictured below
 With the hieroglyphicable prolifical flow

<|endoftext|>
I kneel where the rebels prayed
 Seen 50 grey, but they need better shades

<|endoftext|>
It's hard to explain how these pyramids formed I arrived on the planet, never took the Southside for granted
 Smoke a little, keep a high standard

<|endoftext|>
I walk like an Egyptian on a mission to listen to conditions
 Envision a vision of what we wishing

<|endoftext|>
I've been commissioned to deprison the prism of your mind
 Spit the wisdom of the one divine

<|endoftext|>
Oh I can, yo man, rewind that
 Me and Dion back in the zone, I'm doing shows with Tone

<|endoftext|>
No I.D., Twilite Tone, where the story begin This one's for my man J Dilla
 As I say these words, my eyes fill up

<|endoftext|>
I go to the D, "peace yo, big love"
 Cook up some hot shit, then go to the strip club

<|endoftext|>
It was hard for me to come home every day
 And see my homie Jay's life fade away

<|endoftext|>
Wishing we could have that time back
 Oh we can, yo man, rewind that

<|endoftext|>
Shout outs to No I.D
 Shout outs to Chicago

<|endoftext|>
Yo, this is my sixteen bars
 Feed live souls with two fish and five loaves

<|endoftext|>
Not a storm of the brain makes these niggas drive slow
 Like I was five-O but my creeds Apollo

<|endoftext|>
On a rocky road with Dakota's live show
 For those before I came I make the song cry for

<|endoftext|>
I spend a great time with the rhyme
 More than I did any female

<|endoftext|>
I derailed your train of thought
 Because your brain was caught

<|endoftext|>
Like a fiend in Chi I'm down with rehab
 Stir my style crazy

<|endoftext|>
I make brothers say "True"
 They see you and be like "Fiction"

<|endoftext|>
I'm sayin' I wanna stay inside
 They say I'm a deep nigga, I'ma go way inside

<|endoftext|>
'Cause you the type of dame to be game and yo
 Mic check like the way I begin my show

<|endoftext|>
This is business strictly, step to my business is risky
 'Specially when you as bitch as Missy

<|endoftext|>
I only want to be a soldier, I'm holding on, to a culture
 Focused like Gordon Parks when it's sorta dark

<|endoftext|>
This is that automatic
 I stay fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic

<|endoftext|>
Charismatic, Asiatic
 I hustle for mathematics

<|endoftext|>
Gucci rockin', coochies poppin'
 Movie watchin', booties droppin'

<|endoftext|>
I touch the masses like a Catholic
 Expensive rap shit, my future's backlit

<|endoftext|>
And trance to melodic Technotronic
 Beats knockin', seats droppin'

<|endoftext|>
Seeds poppin', streets rockin'
 Freakin', shakin, money makin'

<|endoftext|>
Rock the fly shit like every day
 To the top and I'm on my way, let's go, uhh

<|endoftext|>
Raised in the temple of Chi, taught to look into the eye
 I identify with dobbs and weaves, and niggas makin moves

<|endoftext|>
Never agree with the ways of the world
 Cats say anything - like they say to they girl

<|endoftext|>
How yo' man pullin yo' weight - he ain't carryin his
 Scary the biz is like "The Blair Witch Project"

<|endoftext|>
Get a mouth shot, for openin your mouth to say
 Feel my heat in the night - it leaves you without the day

<|endoftext|>
I tap into my own zone like it's my home phone
 Turn the cell off and let my dome roam

<|endoftext|>
Shame I gotta do white labels to keep my life stable
 I write fatal bringin niggas to life

<|endoftext|>
There's something 'bout this day that seem good to me
 When niggas I ain't like is showin' love to me

<|endoftext|>
Intellectual buildin', intersexual healin'
 No stickin' movers, and no quick shooters

<|endoftext|>
And baby's mamas supported and ladies gettin' courted
 In court, kids can't be tried as adults

<|endoftext|>
I'm (easy!) easy, easy like Sunday morning
 I can kick a stupid nervous joint when I'm yawning

<|endoftext|>
I'm trippin-and-dippin-and-slippin with the rhyme like Sliiiii-mer!
 (Who ya gonna call?) Ghostbuster

<|endoftext|>
Maybe cause my guy's in love, I'm just hating
 We're waiting on Reverend Clayton and for her to get ready

<|endoftext|>
The church bells is ringing and the ring is real heavy
 Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy It's a Black wedding, you know it started late

<|endoftext|>
To her being his Mrs., it's a big mistake
 I feel the same way, I'm tryna be supportive

<|endoftext|>
We're walking down the aisle, the CD is skipping
 I read between the lines, see, that's the sign

<|endoftext|>
I ain't do all this work for shit
 My style's my child I gave birth to it

<|endoftext|>
And color him purple (why?), 'cause he ain't in my circle
 Now I'm talkin' square biz to you and I'm out

<|endoftext|>
Fucking and laughing 'til its bed time
 You might also like Red like my lips

<|endoftext|>
Make my head spin
 I like dancing

Yo, I was a piano player in my last lifetime
 Now I write rhymes, sip white wine and let my light shine

Repeat this psalm, to the sky I'm keepin my palms
 Facin the east, actions macin the beast

<|endoftext|>
Com Sense, '92 and I'm still in this Time travelin, took my time in hand
 My rhyme learn and plan

<|endoftext|>
Come to Esau in a year, he'll have freedom
 He ask why I hadn't been to see him

<|endoftext|>
As I say it, the spirits enwhip me
 He was raised in the belly of the city

<|endoftext|>
6'9", big heart, big mind
 He he spent a lifetime tryin' to be big time

<|endoftext|>
He did in a way, he made to the ABA
 And the things he say on my record

<|endoftext|>
His perspective: somehow it shaped me
 His perspective: undoubted I feel it

<|endoftext|>
Love never gave a limit, wait a minute, stay up in it
 Every day we give it, play to win it, way we live it

<|endoftext|>
The lap of love we lay up in it
 Days is vivid same incentive

<|endoftext|>
The unfamiliarity made me loose calories
 In a house with wine playing Amy's "Valerie"

<|endoftext|>
This is alchemy, unashamed and undoubtedly
 Now I see This love's alive, it clicks the way that T.D. Jakes described it

<|endoftext|>
State in you relating to the faith in you
 Awaken to what faith can do

<|endoftext|>
The baby-sitter of styles - I've traveled miles with
 Bitches and....I've traveled miles with.....

<|endoftext|>
Instinct to hustle-divided by the struggle
 Plus a couple of scuffle's and up to high shuffle

<|endoftext|>
Like nobody's watchin in a b-boy stance to the hey
 I'm funky like Africans in France to the hey

<|endoftext|>
The rise and fall
 Of a nation, even when the buildings tumble, I still stand tall

<|endoftext|>
I walk through the valley with a life preserver
 Feeling at times, that I might just murder

<|endoftext|>
Somehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it
 Music is a gift that is sacred

<|endoftext|>
Similair to Africa the streets is our safari
 From shanties in slums, is children with guns

<|endoftext|>
They hit the innocent now they families miss him
 Death do kissed him, in his last breath he wishing

<|endoftext|>
I'm living in this shit while the world exploit it
 War My basic training was aiming, hustling, banging, changing niggas up

<|endoftext|>
Freedom riders need passengers
 In your lyrics use scriptures and passages

<|endoftext|>
Early b-boy, down with d-boys, build and destroy
 My pride and joy is my daughter named Omoye

<|endoftext|>
On my paper like headlines, she want the head shine e'ry time
 My time, the streets is watching like a Rollie

<|endoftext|>
But I knew I could and work that all on my dreams
 They tell me find that place, find that place Deep in my destination, trying to find my destination

<|endoftext|>
Imperial reign came down to crown me
 Now in a dream is where I'll be

<|endoftext|>
But the game is the game, so let it begin
 In these streets, these are the seven deadly sins

<|endoftext|>
It's the arrogance, they say, in us Americans
 Messes up marriages, many sins, pride is parenting

<|endoftext|>
Cops getting paid off, greedy companies got my people getting laid off
 Before I sign off, in the sins we livin'

<|endoftext|>
Felt the southside venom in raw hides and denim
 Pimp minds collide wit em, a system that tries victims

<|endoftext|>
We living in, my man in the fast lane pivoting
 On the block white is selling like Eminem

<|endoftext|>
Shorties get the game but no instructions to assembling
 Eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dimming them

<|endoftext|>
Call my man cuzzo, like I'm kin to him
 He trying to stay straight, the streets is bending him

<|endoftext|>
Some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for
 Cats is colder than four below, wit self I go toe to toe

<|endoftext|>
Po' livin in more prisons, pointing to my mind, shine the light up
 Clench my fists tight, holding the right up

<|endoftext|>
I be livin' like I need a Lamborghini
 I make it happen I would never need a genie

<|endoftext|>
I'm like a Nina got designer for my armor
 Lookin' for a presidential nigga like Barbara

<|endoftext|>
Drive down Lake Shore, scheming how to make more
 If we ain't eating together what is this cake for?

<|endoftext|>
Then here come the fame
 But they won't say no names

<|endoftext|>
The stylist and violence with vibrance
 The sign of times with rhyme shit is timeless

<|endoftext|>
The mind is a terrible thing to spill
 Rap life's like a dream that seems for real

<|endoftext|>
So I rhyme when my back hurts
 Play the numbers from my grandmother like Kraftwerk

<|endoftext|>
Sophisticated sissies strut like this is Beat Street in backpacks
 Braggin how they don't eat meat and abstract

<|endoftext|>
I backsmack em with they skateboard, flee the crime scene
 With a rhyme scheme to escape frauds

<|endoftext|>
The unconditional, critical mission, listen to
 The indivisible, mystical, it was meant for you

<|endoftext|>
In 2005, you saved lives by the Bayou
 I know you in the mouth of the spouse singing, "I do"

<|endoftext|>
Something to be from the slum and be the one
 This is where he at, this is where he from Living life with no fear

<|endoftext|>
I popped out the cold hip-hop, that was gold
 The way of the road is our ode to the legacy

<|endoftext|>
Wearin' articles of black like Ebony
 Since I was a shorty I was thinking longevity

<|endoftext|>
I don't stress it baby
 They say you got me dressing crazy

<|endoftext|>
Eating veggies, wearing shirts extra medium
 And if we break up, I'ma eat meat again?

<|endoftext|>
I tell you when you look good and keep it right there
 I'm as important to the Chi as my nigga Mike Air

<|endoftext|>
Jordan 3s on the feet as we breeze down Lake Shore
 These are the days that we bake more to make more

<|endoftext|>
I been living in the moment lately
 It's like the love and the hate seem to motivate me

<|endoftext|>
I read my daughter's name slowly, I'm asleep, sleepin'
 With the TV on, two in the morn', "Who the hell is this?"

<|endoftext|>
Inside I'm sad, dustin' off my pride
 I thought that I did protect and provide, and I'm a father that's live

<|endoftext|>
I ride around town like this is my town
 Rapping to myself, trying to see how I sound

<|endoftext|>
Kinda arrogant 'cause I’m from Chi Town
 East bound & down, that’s how we get down

<|endoftext|>
At the bar taking shots like they live rounds
 My lifestyle is it’s good to be alive now

<|endoftext|>
Pound the ground we own the concrete jungle
 Surround me loudly, wildly is how we came up

<|endoftext|>
The willingness to know that I don’t know shit Enrichened souls, visions, goals, mission grows as I do
 It was written like a haiku when I was seventeen

<|endoftext|>
Maybe I’m a clown, got me crying out in front the crowd
 On the inside but it feel like a fuckin’ cloud

<|endoftext|>
And I recognize this strong goal
 But I keeps on going

<|endoftext|>
People dreaming they live free
 Making love while they in love

<|endoftext|>
Free a nigga mind, free a nigga dome
 Freedom is a line (Damn), even if it's long

<|endoftext|>
I'm into fine things, like dining with fine things (Common)
 My dreams found wings on the back of the struggle

<|endoftext|>
Pull a back muscle, back to the hustle
 Rap for the duffle and the black couples

<|endoftext|>
High school I came out it
 Cats with clout at graduation got they name shouted

<|endoftext|>
Against the wall me and my guys formed a colony, Ron'll be beatin'
 Saved my day, dancin' on speakers

<|endoftext|>
Flames snatched I was born this way
 87th Street and Hyde Park was warrin'

<|endoftext|>
Travellin' like Vice Lords, down to the Taste
 Not wantin' to bring my lady around crew 'cause they would snake

<|endoftext|>
Remindin' me of the pointed parties Moe used to make
 Six deep in the Hyundai bumpin' Twilight Tone tapes

<|endoftext|>
Tim'll be basin' Mike down at I.I.T
 Rememberin' numbers depended on how high I'd be

<|endoftext|>
Unapologetic, unashamed with it
 Times in life, I came with it

<|endoftext|>
When the unseen became vivid
 Of different flesh, same spirit

<|endoftext|>
I know it's a peace, it's hard to find
 I went out there found mine decide

<|endoftext|>
I'm alive on arrival
 My life is more than survival

<|endoftext|>
You can live and be live too
 That's how heaven will describe you Look life in the eye, I can see clearer

<|endoftext|>
Guided steps I don't take for granted
 Time is manic we internalize

<|endoftext|>
While I'm coolin' in my jumpers and my big pants
 I'm as dope as PCP; MC's see me and they start having flashbacks

<|endoftext|>
Words I'm weldin' like James Johnson
 My brains sponsorin' speech on the mic, I'm like a Jackson

<|endoftext|>
They say it's violent time in human beings
 But being they ain't seeing me as human

<|endoftext|>
Mutilate me from my family, society, and loved ones
 I wasn't raised to love guns, well maybe toy ones

<|endoftext|>
Nigga deep in the rhythm, experience speaks
 I'm keepin' the wisdom, the life hustlers seek

<|endoftext|>
Under the cherry moon, I hold notes and carry tunes
 My guys pack heat, enough to bury June

<|endoftext|>
On my feet, I'm getting married soon
 Walking in the clouds like Mary Bethune

<|endoftext|>
Hold on to your life as I carry these styles
 To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles

<|endoftext|>
A poster shines of me holding the blinds
 Mixing goldenseal and wine, holding a nine Between churches and liquor stores, my mic leaks

<|endoftext|>
On the sink, got my momma a mink
 Think Common is the link

<|endoftext|>
Came to shitty deals, reminiscing gives me chills
 When Puff was with Biggie, Versace on every niggie

<|endoftext|>
You might also like As I sit back, relax with Chicago on my back
 Unzip the backpack, pull out a fifth of 'gnac

<|endoftext|>
I stagger in the gatherin'
 Possessed by a patter-in that be scatterin'

<|endoftext|>
Over the global, my vocals be travellin', unravellin' my abdomen
 It's slime that's babblin', grammatics that are masculine

<|endoftext|>
Got more verses than a Kramer, go off like a pager
 Skills uglier than Craig Mack in your ear, I'm the flavor

<|endoftext|>
You might also like I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike
 When in dim light, I use insight to enlight

<|endoftext|>
Then write somethin' that's skin tight
 Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight

<|endoftext|>
I send light, like Ben's kite, I've been bright
 Get open like on gym nights and in fights, I send rights

<|endoftext|>
Don't hook with skins my friends like, I spend nights up in dykes
 I've been indicted as a freak of all trades

<|endoftext|>
Doodoo-Doo-Doo, Doo-Doo, I got it made
 I bathe in basslines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums

<|endoftext|>
Hablo ingles? I don't know espanol Joe
 I can go the line plus a hundred like Flo Jo

<|endoftext|>
Homo's a nono, so faggots, stay solo
 I roll my dick so it holds just like a Rolo

<|endoftext|>
I told her hold (hold) tight (tight), I'd be right over
 Freezin but this situation made the night colder

<|endoftext|>
By now, I'm thinkin bout my gun if I
 See gramps bracelet

<|endoftext|>
When the day breaks, I display grace
 Through infinite takes, and heartbreaks

<|endoftext|>
The ground shakes, talks around race
 Through birth quakes, I keep my crown straight

<|endoftext|>
The paradigm shifted and parentin' is different
 Black woman strength in search of vulnerability

<|endoftext|>
Imagine life that bring us Lauryn Hill-type of singers
 Even the righteous schemers still let Christ redeem us

<|endoftext|>
Life is greener on this side, the bеauty that we see
 Be coming from inside, imaginе if

<|endoftext|>
Imagine having a woman like Betty Shabazz
 Steady with class, ready to blast 'til the chariots pass

<|endoftext|>
To take me to my new destination
 I think in miracles, it's my imagination Imagine days divine, no longer in a race with time

<|endoftext|>
Might see 'em on my arm
 Cause I charm like thick chains

<|endoftext|>
Game begins, games begins
 I'm from the windy city, so I play to win We conversated tough about life and stuff

<|endoftext|>
I'm the black guy in the flick with Angelina Jolie
 Boldly, she told me 'Oh you got moves'

<|endoftext|>
Try to get me, get wet like bed sheets
 Probably with technique, and let the Tec speak

<|endoftext|>
While I'm out on bond tryin' to buy my time
 'Til I hit the main line in that cell confined

<|endoftext|>
She seen pain in my eye
 Men and women at work, cranes in the sky

<|endoftext|>
I used to wear my heart open like Ethereal Rose
 Now I'm carrying loads of baggage I don't claim

<|endoftext|>
I tried to dance it away
 I tried to change it with my hair I ran my credit card bill up

<|endoftext|>
Think I made myself dizzy
 I slept it away, I sexed it away

<|endoftext|>
Confront the day, I want a way
 To make sense of it, yeah, it's amaze-ment

<|endoftext|>
We the tribe of Levi, cut them jeans knee-high
 I think that it would be wise to read the book of Eli-jah Mohammad

<|endoftext|>
You might also like He spoke with his eyes, tear-filled
 A lump in his throat, his fear built

<|endoftext|>
I felt like he failed me
 'Til his spirit yelled help me

<|endoftext|>
I'd known him for like what seemed forever
 About going pro we dreamed together

<|endoftext|>
Scriptures turn to pages, pictures burn in rages
 Outrageous, the big world, the stage is set

<|endoftext|>
Sound the trumpets, I got soldiers by the hundreds
 We all want it with our eyes on the summit

<|endoftext|>
But this the year that we doing it with no fears
 God in both ears saying ''be sincere''

<|endoftext|>
Through stages of life, the world's my Wembley
 I emcee, from the point of entry

<|endoftext|>
And some find they peace through pullin' the shades like Malcolm
 I found my peace, my peace makin' these albums, peace In dystopia, ground zero from xenophobia

<|endoftext|>
While I'm channelin' my energy from particle to wave
 The peace, like Mandela seated on Robben Island

<|endoftext|>
Went to the kitchen for that cake she was tweakin'
 He gave reasons, now she believin'

<|endoftext|>
To make her feel good, he put it on speaker
 So she wouldn't be insecure like Issa

<|endoftext|>
Get bread, get dough, get fed, get mo'
 In the old school Lincoln, thinking I sit low

<|endoftext|>
Remember we were kings, back in the day
 Still can be, depending on the cards you play I ain't playin' with a full deck

<|endoftext|>
You tried to smoke my ace, you know the stakes
 It's high like the ace is

<|endoftext|>
Woke up in a prison cell and I had a revelation
 That my life's a testimony, I could be an inspiration (Yea)

<|endoftext|>
A symphony for the divine
 And we the instruments, Black innocence

<|endoftext|>
Sellin' CDs, reachin' for wallets
 Trayvon'd be in his last year of college

<|endoftext|>
I was told by a wise old to come from the heart
 Though I might've did The Light, I don't run from the dark

<|endoftext|>
The dark knight to spark mics and start fights
 The warrior archetype like Kimbo Slice

<|endoftext|>
You frail on the mic like you might break a nail
 I might smoke a joint but I won't take the L

<|endoftext|>
My life is the style, I stay dressed to kill
 A legend like Will, Smith with the steel

<|endoftext|>
Your guys got you gassed, my flow is a hybrid
 Crashed I survived it, gashes over eyelids

<|endoftext|>
Syncopated is the style that I fight with, write with
 Mr. Excitement change your face up like a white chick

<|endoftext|>
And out is how I'm lookin, I'm lookin out for my people
 I'm fly like I'm fly like but me don't have no eagle

<|endoftext|>
Cause I remember the time, the time, the time you tried
 To play me like I was booty but now you're just a groupie

<|endoftext|>
To the Charms Alarm
 You might also like I got the pep in my step, the slide in my glide

<|endoftext|>
Like the 'pollo, I, the holy spirit of Chicago
 Married to the game, I should have took the bitch to Cabo

<|endoftext|>
I know, I know like Bill Withers, feel niggas
 They say, "Stay safe" but they still hit us

<|endoftext|>
Forеver signed to the artform, no, things didn't start warm
 Wrinkles in time 'til I met my Tony Starks form

<|endoftext|>
This the not-need edition, Planet Rock reinvention
 The lock key ignition to them Ali dimensions

<|endoftext|>
Took time off to never rhyme soft, my mind's off
 The grid that I climbed off, I'm live 'til I sign off

<|endoftext|>
My man Murray said, "never take your shine off,"
 Sometimes I go offline to get these lines off

<|endoftext|>
My crown chakra's like a Chi-town opera
 Violence, violence, they broke in my crib and seen Oscars

<|endoftext|>
My shape's earthless, I came to earth's surface
 To reverse curses and birth purpose, my verse nurtures

<|endoftext|>
As far as freestyles, I go wild like no churches
 My occupation, greatness is my coworker

<|endoftext|>
Like uh Warriors rejoice at the voice of a black king
 Some say I'm slept on, I symbolize the rap dream

<|endoftext|>
Morpheus morals, black Orpheus orals
 To them we just mortals, to the Lord, we portals

<|endoftext|>
The witty unpredictable, every time this play
 Give Rae his residuals, nine individuals

<|endoftext|>
I'm the untouchable style Capone
 Yellin', "peace," on the phone while it's wild at home

<|endoftext|>
I ain't catch no cases like the NBA bubble
 Too much talkin' and flexin' stimulate trouble

<|endoftext|>
Like a blind man's rebuttal to see what I'm sayin'
 Kaepernick of this rap shit, you see I ain't playin'

<|endoftext|>
I'm doing movies, niggas askin' me for features
 Lifetime achiever like Queen Latifah

<|endoftext|>
I'm going downtown like Julie Brown, I'm the round mound
 Not of rebound, but like a hound, I get down-down

<|endoftext|>
Me go with mi amigo, to see the man named Chico
 The legal alienaeno, I roll the instrumentals

<|endoftext|>
Bouncin', mystic, realistic
 And simplistic, spirits visit

<|endoftext|>
How we live it, it's intrinsic
 Kismet kissed it, it's smeared like lipstick

<|endoftext|>
Celebratin' my peeps when I innovate
 For my dons and divas weighin' odds and evens

<|endoftext|>
A tear laid in my eye, I was afraid to reply
 To the hurt that was callin', it came from the sky

<|endoftext|>
I'm hittin' rum straight, thinkin' of a route to truncate
 The streets is watchin', out is one way I put myself in his Nike's

<|endoftext|>
Take tricks and let's dip, we can do something hip
 Take a trip around the world in a day, play Fiona A

<|endoftext|>
I'm going downtown like Julie Brown, I'm the round mound
 Not of rebound, but like a hound, I get down

<|endoftext|>
("I got soul, you got it!") That's why I came
 They keep callin me, man, they keep callin me, they call my name

<|endoftext|>
Ahoy-he-hoy-he, I'm Fat Boy
 Shibidabibidabee, boom boom, I'll be the bad boy

<|endoftext|>
Cause I control minds with rhymes
 So FBI don't test, I got a no. 2 pencil

<|endoftext|>
I didn't see CB4 cause I heard that shit was wack
 Like Chris, I Rock, I'm strapped like my jock

<|endoftext|>
So keep the crossover, Common is a b-boy
 While you be dragging last, I be kicking like Bruce Leroy

<|endoftext|>
But oh no, this was Common with his soul glow
 Coming from Chica- but yo I gotta go-go

<|endoftext|>
I write rhymes like I come from the windy city
 With my crew, I click like simply, stand midi with reality

<|endoftext|>
Casually, I walk through these war games
 Some claim saved but then they take on whore names

<|endoftext|>
It's time to get it, get it made
 I got my mind made up like Foxy Brown's face

<|endoftext|>
Fuck waiting under my skin, the situation is scraping
 Somewhat like the girl X-rating

<|endoftext|>
Make me wanna leave the city when I can't take a vacation
 Without somebody breaking in my demonstration

<|endoftext|>
The plot thickens, as we drove in search of this hype
 Who I ain't know by name, but I knew by bike

<|endoftext|>
A cloudy day in the Chi
 I was downtown getting my license

<|endoftext|>
Money ain't a thang but hey, fame is priceless
 Waiting in line, yeah that's one of my vices

<|endoftext|>
I was shocked inside, but I reacted live
 Told her every time I think of her she actualize

<|endoftext|>
I said fate baby ain't something to rationalize
 Seen passion in her eyes as my words hit her

<|endoftext|>
Shoot the gift and viff, at the myths uplift
 My rhyme the clip, it's like the boom bip to tip

<|endoftext|>
No cowards, soul power in the words we rap Picks with fist, thick grease, dark nipples
 My guy buy ice, I search for the dark crystal

<|endoftext|>
Before I left, this thief decided to play chef
 Overlooked beef in the fridge to cook chicken breast

<|endoftext|>
Is your mind and your right hand free now?
 Our love, reach deep down inside of it

<|endoftext|>
When we (Ahh) I feel the most high in it
 I feel you touchin' me and I begin to rise from it

<|endoftext|>
You are my queen and freak forever
 I feel you inside my stomach

<|endoftext|>
I open my eyes, the corner's like African tribes
 The blackest of thighs, a blackened surprise where passion arise

<|endoftext|>
The corner On the corner, birth place of various dreams
 The ending of the beginning, the scariest thing

<|endoftext|>
As we survive here to die here, whatever we seen
 We accept it, live with it, or better the scheme

<|endoftext|>
Tried to freebase us, mark of the beast, erase us
 But we raised up from East Asia

<|endoftext|>
Listen! I lay terror in this era like Che Guevera
 For the people to make or wait is better

<|endoftext|>
Heart stay open, in you I keep gold
 Crossroads of beast mode to peace mode

<|endoftext|>
Whenever I eat, my peeps get the same entrée
 Like they my fiance

<|endoftext|>
It ain't easy, when niggas like, "Feed me"
 When I ain't got it they don't believe me

<|endoftext|>
I don't give a fuck long as my coke is decent
 And my rims blind the whole damn precinct

<|endoftext|>
And greasy foods, I don't believe the news
 Or radio, stereotypes we refuse

<|endoftext|>
Ex-cape the fire tonight, switch like Jekyll and Hyde
 And shit, wreckin we live and shit

<|endoftext|>
Wiping your nose like you need blows
 Claiming it's a allergy, I react allergic to cats

<|endoftext|>
Infinite landscaper, green paper maker
 Leap far from home with chrome rims and trims

<|endoftext|>
I'm tryna get niggas in the ghetto paid
 While they watch pornos and Escalades

<|endoftext|>
Away from floats and the dope in sex parades
 Somebody screamin in my mind, I'm tryna find if it's me

<|endoftext|>
I just came to chill and build with my guy
 I try to walk but I stumble off the humble path

<|endoftext|>
Like the pyramids and gods, I remain
 I know pain, like Kurt Cobain

<|endoftext|>
Now I write shit, to freeze niggas
 Whether iced out or American pie sliced out

<|endoftext|>
I'm rolling in a Cadillac with the grill fronted
 I ain't even smoke no bo but I feel blunted

<|endoftext|>
Told my team let me get my plays straight and I'ma feed them
 They need me like I need them, you see the streets is bleeding

<|endoftext|>
Had a meeting with my mind on how I can be divine and
 Stay on my grind

<|endoftext|>
Hustlers in Volks, customers and smoke
 I kiss the sky feeling high off the stuff that I wrote

<|endoftext|>
I feel it in my neck, and my back
 A thug came to me, said it changed his life

<|endoftext|>
Said the love of his life, he used to bang to "The Light"
 I'm trying to do better, I ain't claiming Mr. Right

<|endoftext|>
King Kong ain't got shit on me
 I train days to rip emcees

<|endoftext|>
The cusp of generations searching for a ventilation
 If 2020 vision is any indication

<|endoftext|>
My rights are being left behind
 In questioned times, they say invest in nines

<|endoftext|>
Tryna rest my mind, the press be pressed to find
 Stories by my kind, a suggested crime

<|endoftext|>
Plus they wanna crib me, way out in the country
 I'm city like street lights and some games that be fights

<|endoftext|>
Story of many black males that I refuse to rewrite Yo, brothers opinions is Bias-ed, like Len
 That I'll end up like Ben... Wilson—still, some pretend to be friends

<|endoftext|>
My gallant talent is like a magic
 Trick turned by a chick with a bad habit

<|endoftext|>
Or speaking to my fans in a starving artist tone
 Unknown zones I roam with mind architecture

<|endoftext|>
Brighten my life reminded me to stay positive - it's love
 You might also like It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop

<|endoftext|>
They keep asking me who I'm talking 'bout in "Sweet"
 Is it that guy or this guy? This is just, just shy

<|endoftext|>
Trees is blowing, we see change in the wind
 It's a new day and I got to take it in

<|endoftext|>
Cause I was chose to and I'm supposed to I spoke like a child, I wrote like a child
 Always smiled, let my mind float like a child

<|endoftext|>
Days go by, my life on high
 I lead on my wall so the fight don't die

<|endoftext|>
Victory can be claimed while you still battling
 Travel along with the food I provide you

<|endoftext|>
I breathe deep like an old man in a deep sleep
 Or Indian peace pipe in a tepee

<|endoftext|>
Just to get-- by, 'cause I was slept on like a red-eye
 Like Rastafara, I knew to keep my head high

<|endoftext|>
Until you break through, it might take two
 Inhale deep to inflict too, it's great to

<|endoftext|>
I'm like Jeff Fort the way I get behind bars
 Burn CDs with no regard for the stars

<|endoftext|>
Come to the crib with conflict diamonds and they ours
 Back in '94, they called me Chi-town's Nas

<|endoftext|>
A conscious nigga with mack, like Steve Jobs Your fly is open, McFly
 The crowd is open, I think I know why

<|endoftext|>
Just to get his people high So high, born to fly
 Getting high off his own supply

<|endoftext|>
Your majesty with mine is like the highest in a way
 You too fly to fly away, you could be my Mary J

<|endoftext|>
Staying true to you is staying true to me
 Your love language, I speak it fluently, majesty, uh Peace to the Earth, what I see is the birth

<|endoftext|>
Stars align, we combine, we define space and time
 New beginnings our way, new beginnings our way

<|endoftext|>
Women love the voice, brothers dig the lyrics
 This is hip-hop y'all, we driving for the spirit

<|endoftext|>
Rock to Coltrane, listen to jazz then, back then
 We came with names like James, Fatima

<|endoftext|>
The rise and fall, of a nation
 Even when the buildings tumble, I still stand tall

<|endoftext|>
I walk through the valley with a life preserver
 Feeling at times that I might just murder

<|endoftext|>
Some people say when we defeat the beast, the peace will glow
 Lead 'em to the freedom, when I lead 'em, yo, they grow

<|endoftext|>
I might zag zig ya life adlib
 To find my voice, good city, mad kid

<|endoftext|>
I found silence sittin' in my own cottage
 There I had to acknowledge where I'm not polished

<|endoftext|>
In the Jeep, two deep, I'm the passenger
 Rolling with my guy to pick the package up

<|endoftext|>
Behind my eyes, I reach for skies that tell no lies
 The earth, it cries for change that can't be televised

<|endoftext|>
We polarized and synthesized by stimuli
 My heart is why the parts all died, I can't deny

<|endoftext|>
I realize your eternal eyes see through my disguise
 These falls, what do they symbolize?

<|endoftext|>
I know that you made me to rise
 I need pain to feel alive when racism still alive

<|endoftext|>
I was told that life's a bitch, hope that she don't kill my vibe
 I've been still, but still, I rise

<|endoftext|>
Your grace and will are still alive
 I can read again, believin' in the deeds amend

<|endoftext|>
Your likeness, we created it, it's where we begin
 Yeah, into the— Some days, I don't have the energy

<|endoftext|>
The city it blow deep, I know them cold streets
 Motif is no peace, can't trust the police

<|endoftext|>
My mama stay out East, hope that she good though
 She from Inglewood so she know the hood though

<|endoftext|>
Fire inside me and things that go "Bow Bow"
 Label me wild child, my old man on trial now

<|endoftext|>
Grew up on concrete where we couldn't escape black
 Listen to MCs who made me take thеy tape back

<|endoftext|>
Rewind, black stars align
 Help mе define exactly who I am

<|endoftext|>
From where my strength come is the same place I bled hurt
 Crossin' the 7 is like crossin' a desert

<|endoftext|>
I'm glad I seen Bianca, she reminded me
 No matter how far I go, to keep findin' me

<|endoftext|>
I'm locked in, find the key, my mind is free
 I took time with me, it took time to see that—

<|endoftext|>
Whether facing the East or facing the beast
 I'ma keep fighting 'til the world say, "Peace"

<|endoftext|>
My success is a verb, it's a blessing to serve
 My presence is heard, I'm investing in words

<|endoftext|>
In a nation that asks me for identification
 I'm a Haitian, I'm Jamaican

<|endoftext|>
I love the messages my love be sending me
 Chicago chase so I love being finicky

<|endoftext|>
Love calling him "Cuzzo", even if he ain't kin to me
 Love drinking wine while my homie drink Hennessy

<|endoftext|>
Yo, yo I gotta run with a different type of style, yo a different type of flow
 I'm from Chicago, yo I got the snowplow

<|endoftext|>
Snowplow and you know that's not soul glo
 Common sense sometimes I go solo

<|endoftext|>
I'm in the green you see me in the limousine
 And we be on the team

<|endoftext|>
Yo, I got this sheen like my man Questlove with the afro
 Sometimes I battle sometimes I straddle formality

<|endoftext|>
Common Sense I'm the realest in virtual reality
 Comin' real with this type of style from the Stoney Isle

<|endoftext|>
I stagger in the gathering possessed by a patter-in
 That be scatterin'

<|endoftext|>
Over the global my vocals be travellin'
 Unravellin' my abdomen it's slime that's babblin'

<|endoftext|>
Acoustic basslines embrace rhymes while I chase mines
 They say signs of the end is near

<|endoftext|>
Skull-cap smurf, Puffy jacket, Lugz boots on
 Steppin' to me is like goin' to the County being a Neutron I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike

<|endoftext|>
When in dim light, I use insight to enlight
 Then write something that's skin tight

<|endoftext|>
I send light, like Ben's kite I've been bright
 Get open like on gym nights

<|endoftext|>
And in fights I send rights
 Don't hook with skins my friends like

<|endoftext|>
(That's right) I got it made
 I bathe in basslines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums

<|endoftext|>
When I get to seeing just how great I am
 Many many times from mistakes, I ran

<|endoftext|>
I'm an instrument, stay in tune with me
 This orchestrated by Karriem, Samora, Boom, and me

<|endoftext|>
If agape had a Cupid, she'd be shooting me
 This rap here is fear's eulogy

<|endoftext|>
I maintained the sauce and became a boss
 I apologize if I came across

<|endoftext|>
Became childlike with the way I style right
 And act, because children naturally react

<|endoftext|>
Some say I'm spaced like John Glenn cause of the places I've been
 I embrace the vibe, spin, been through cases of Heinekin

<|endoftext|>
Hear Beyonce's song and she gotta perform
 Whether fucking or fighting: we getting it on I don't even say shit, she can feel it

<|endoftext|>
My ghetto housewife watch reality shows
 She might get to snapping when the cabinets ain't closed

<|endoftext|>
Pain onto my game, wanted and I'm sadistic
 They liked it, they dyked it, devices twisted

<|endoftext|>
Hypocrite, I’m fillin' out your death certificate
 Slangin' Bean Pies and St. Ides in the same sentence

<|endoftext|>
I'm from Chi, I went to Cali, niggas gave me love
 There's a thin line between, the fake and the real

<|endoftext|>
-ssary, under pressure, children feeling lesser
 With the steel up on the dresser killin' will aggressors

<|endoftext|>
Like a thief in the night, I write the beacons of light
 For those of us in dark alleys and parched valleys

<|endoftext|>
One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us
 True and livin' livin' in us, resistance is us

<|endoftext|>
When I don’t even know their name
 Just seen what flick they was in

<|endoftext|>
You might also like Chigga-chigga, ooh, aah, ooh ahh, OH NO! Catch me, I'm fallin'
 Why do fools fall? To the break, to the break, bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye, y'all

<|endoftext|>
They say you grime like Skepta
 I let 'em know, I disrespect-uh

<|endoftext|>
Free the mind and see the rhyme
 And we design, these things and see in time

<|endoftext|>
That I'ma keep climbing mountains, I've been doing it
 Pursuing it, I've been on this music tip for a second

<|endoftext|>
If I need it, then I just proceed with
 These types of styles that I make emcees bleed with

<|endoftext|>
Yo, I came to climb, boy
 Listen to the rhyme that I design, boy

<|endoftext|>
Years of my career, now it's clear that I wanna
 Appear to my peers, yo I'm here for the corner

<|endoftext|>
Many ends seem to close in
 Death is where life begins

<|endoftext|>
I'm in overtime, trying to open mine
 Seen the riches souls defined in the forest people

<|endoftext|>
We keep e-e-e-erupting time
 Cut us we gon' bleed up divine (Geez)

<|endoftext|>
Pull a back muscle, back to the hustle
 Rap for the duffle and the black couples

<|endoftext|>
'Til my homey asked, ("WASSUP WIT DAT?")
 The dat was like dis, see, I told him I got busy

<|endoftext|>
Fly by night, for you in the sky I write
 These cold Chi night's moon, you my light

<|endoftext|>
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
 Better or worse times, I hope to me you call

<|endoftext|>
I pray every day more than anything
 Friends we'll stay as we begin to lay

<|endoftext|>
Suggestin' beats I should rhyme to
 When I'm lost I try to find you

<|endoftext|>
Truthfully, it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
 The time we committed love, it was real good

<|endoftext|>
In the right way, told her, "Inside is where the fight lay
 Everything a nigga do may not be what he might say"

<|endoftext|>
Chicago nights they, stay on the mind
 I write many lives, they, lay on these lines

<|endoftext|>
Wavin' signs of the times, many say the grind's on the mind
 Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wanna rhyme

<|endoftext|>
The thin line between love and hatred
 I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life

<|endoftext|>
They say life is what you make it
 So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it

<|endoftext|>
I write just to free minds, from Stony to Rikers
 Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is

<|endoftext|>
Writin' for my life 'cause I'm scared of a day job
 They say "Sef kept the hood together"

<|endoftext|>
Now I claim "King" like Don, or Frank White
 They say my life is comparable to Christ's

<|endoftext|>
The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice
 They say "The crochet pants and the sweater was wack"

<|endoftext|>
Yo, excite-ting, enlight-ning, invite-ing
 I'm writing shit that I feel

<|endoftext|>
Asked my guy how he thought travelling the world sound
 Found it hard to imagine, he hadn't been past downtown

<|endoftext|>
In her name, though the place was his
 They tryna take everything except the kids

<|endoftext|>
Dreamin' when I wrote this, box me if I go too wild
 Still doin' this shit like dude in Wild Style

<|endoftext|>
Say it short (Hey)
 All the ladies say (Hey)

<|endoftext|>
My man had to dig deep to find his
 Couldn't sleep, on the real, he had five kids

<|endoftext|>
Live nig's, real niggas express and taste it
 At crap games, black dames and big faces

<|endoftext|>
Hyprocrite, I'm fillin' out your Death Certificate
 Slangin' bean pies and St Ides in the same sentence

<|endoftext|>
Yo, real People walk in the streets, the streets is talkin'
 Often it's beef this city never does

<|endoftext|>
It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on
 I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong

<|endoftext|>
Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays
 Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality

<|endoftext|>
The baby-sitter of styles - I've traveled miles with
 Bitches and....I've traveled miles with.....

<|endoftext|>
It's to my real ill niggas, heavyweight hitters
 Dough-getters, fifty ways to make figures

<|endoftext|>
Rock it all night long, the bang-a-thon, baby
 Keep hangin' on, we like it with the lights on

<|endoftext|>
And then they display tricks like The Matrix
 Make the record fly, undetected by the naked eye

<|endoftext|>
On some behind-the-back shit, catch it and scratch it
 Blast it, this kid got his craft mastered

<|endoftext|>
Hands is mad quick like he mix with magic
 Spin it back and forth and grab it

<|endoftext|>
Mind travel, design style like apparel
 My fashions last long as a lifetime

<|endoftext|>
‘Cause I can see the future when the god write rhymes
 They're mad ‘cause I managed to reign so long

<|endoftext|>
Follow procedures, the crowd couldn’t wait to see this
 Nobody been this long-awaited since Jesus

<|endoftext|>
My only challenge is not to explode in violence
 I’m Asiatic, and blazin' microphones' a habit

<|endoftext|>
Aye yo, technical difficulties is through When I flow tonight, I'll show ‘em new heights I go to write
 They know I strike with new prototypes to blow the mic

<|endoftext|>
At night, the open mic be invitin' me to rhyme
 So, yo, I’m online, it’s been a long time

<|endoftext|>
While I admire MIDI, with more vision than TVs
 I find it easy catchin' diabetes from fly sweeties

<|endoftext|>
I'm in effect, quicker than medicines in China
 Split the mic open, fill it with somethin' potent to go in

<|endoftext|>
I'mma move crowds to two-thousand and somethin' My rhymes and lyrics find spirits like a seance
 Since fat crayons, I write and display chaos

<|endoftext|>
My plan is damage, the diagram to where the jam is
 I take advantage until the crowd go bananas

<|endoftext|>

I gotta get by, but there's no time for pity
 It's easy to die when you're living for the city I'm in a zone everywhere I seem to roam is home

<|endoftext|>
A rolling stone, I hold my own just like a microphone
 I stay in tune, travel in harmony and set the tone

<|endoftext|>
I went to L.A. to get with Dre, we tried to bridge the gap and
 Take night, mix it with day, I guess it wasn't meant to happen

My move, a lotta dudes hope I lose but it's cool baby
 I'm like Ray, I make it "Do what it do" baby

Come through in a by, lean low like I'm doin a crime
 Empty ya nines and bend in the dime

<|endoftext|>
Forty-five is bustin, like live percussion
 Will them thighs be bobbin

<|endoftext|>
That's why we try to stay alive in hustlin
 But some of us die for nothing

 There's no vision whole hit in the motion picture

<|endoftext|>
This is the shit, they don't have to blast
 So grab your glass, and your grass, and your hash

Filled with smoke when I wrote it
 Potent, hear it get leery, weary when quotin'

The chosen, Rakim is classic, time so far past it
 Masses won't grasp it 'til I'm in the casket

Unloadin', mic chokin' smoke keep clappin' 'til it's broken
 Pop open, like emptyin' a ratchet

<|endoftext|>
Or raw rocks off of the block, the audience bump
 'Til the cops run in the spot like I'm wanted for drugs

<|endoftext|>
Fit bodies in they Armanis, mix karate with pilates
 Yeah, they hobby's with Papi put tsunami's in their punanis

Yeah, but I won't lose my shirt
 Since I'm smooth, I play it Kool like Herc

<|endoftext|>

He claim to be containing me when he ain't
 Who you holding? Knowing i'm a beast in the paint (in the paint)

I take it straight to the rack like (claim to fame)
 Bring your A game and get your B game {?}

<|endoftext|>
I break (reign on his claim to fame) (uh)
 Get you game face on

<|endoftext|>

We're dealing with some devious days
 But believe me it's ways

 That means take it back

<|endoftext|>
And go through many extremes, by any means
 But I don't need a military, I'm ill already

<|endoftext|>
Race brutality because of my nationality
 And this is what they call reality

With bad bitches, put 'em aside, I used to be thirsty creeping
 Now I'm out working evenings, birthdays, even Tuesdays

<|endoftext|>
No assignments, book of rhyming and I'm drawing doodles

<|endoftext|>
With the clean black slacks and the jacket to match
 Found your way back like a Cadillac with the flats

<|endoftext|>

I rewind, Nas track 6, rewind dance crazes
 Read my mind, freed my mind, feed my mind, makes sense

<|endoftext|>
My earlobes, they yellow like the yolk is runnin'
 Brain on drugs, I still ain't got no peace of mind, fuck

<|endoftext|>
Woof, woof—dogs in the place, loose tooth—lost in the fray
 Roof lost on the Wraith, roof lost on the way

<|endoftext|>
Jewelry cloth, my gold caps
 NY throwback like the old Fab (I'm undone because)

<|endoftext|>
Lost in the Google Maps in your iMac, think my phone tapped
 Hold up, hold that (Hold on, my nigga, hold that—) (I'm undone because) thought

<|endoftext|>
When it's my time to go, adiós, vámonos
 Flacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with plátanos

<|endoftext|>
My mama named me, my papa gave me cock to take a piss with
 To fuck ya bitch with, life is different for me, for instance

All white, like I was right up in the Dakotas
 Or Minnesota, did I mention soda?

<|endoftext|>
Putting holes in a nigga getting close enough
 BME 'til the credits roll

<|endoftext|>
The prize in my jeans my balls'll never digress
 I'm a dick that I brag about

<|endoftext|>
Cause the last thing that I need's a string attached to me
 I'm a bachelor, bitch, and I ain't in no fast fury

<|endoftext|>
We vowed this, mixin' yayo with soda powder
 Who woulda known he would fold and cower?

<|endoftext|>
Once the captain showed he sold to Old McDonald
 So it's no X and O's

<|endoftext|>
Ain't tryin' to meet new faces, this don't interest me
 Even if we bubble slow we'll get it eventually

<|endoftext|>
So it's no X and O's
 TEC's, Calico's aimed at your chest, nigga

<|endoftext|>
That'll eat ya, niggas wanna keep speaking
 Like it ain't even that deep

<|endoftext|>
Sneaky as fuck, I don't think mama beat me enough

<|endoftext|>
Alcoholics, sluts, and fucking wife beaters
 I guess that describes my life

<|endoftext|>
I don't even know who song this is (Obie Trice)
 Bitch, Bizarre don't give a fuck about no hip hop

<|endoftext|>
We used to blaze with the bitch
 Faded off the lick she x-rated the clip

<|endoftext|>
Meanwhile in the hood she drivin around good
 This bitch thinks she's in Hollywood

<|endoftext|>
Meantime she settin the nigga up
 Telling us what his stuff she's ready to get him stuck, what?

<|endoftext|>
And I don't wanna hear X-Y-Z

Okay, okie dokey Obie's here
 No more Focus Hobo's got a career

<|endoftext|>
I ain't got time to waste, let's vacate the place
 Shut blinds and drapes, grind to your face in a grimy state

<|endoftext|>
Ten hoodrat chicks surround me outside
 Found me outside, clown me outside

<|endoftext|>
And I ain't got time to play
 Let's investigate another place today

<|endoftext|>
Ladies less in weight and the dress they shape
 Dresses pettite, no window drapes

<|endoftext|>
Ayo I'm focused, it's the locust
 O. Trice is holding the soldiers, the prognosis

<|endoftext|>
Probably why I rose from zero to hope
 Cause I was wide eyed and open nosed on my approach

<|endoftext|>
Nigga, hold the toast you provoke
 44 Snub hugs my scrotum when I roll

<|endoftext|>
Yes I hold my own, so if you think you Deebo's clone
 I'm aimin, watch I'm switchin to Damon

<|endoftext|>
I, hold the toast when I approach
 It's close at all times by my side in the holster

<|endoftext|>
And this differentiates life where murder being the case
 And since murder was the case, it just means niggas erase

<|endoftext|>
And the plan is not to be layin in earth's land
 I will pop before decayin in earth's land

<|endoftext|>
She ride by my corner like, "I'm not gonna cry
 I would not reap the pain of watching my youngest man

<|endoftext|>
When you could do the same, but that respect is given
 Our intimacy is significantly different We ain't even got to talk when we see each other

<|endoftext|>
Satisfy - this my bitch that ride
 My bitch with the pistol in the ride

<|endoftext|>
I came in the game profane, no image
 I came in the game with a name I was given

<|endoftext|>
Now they want my brains on the main road
 But they don't understand what I came for

<|endoftext|>
Don't ever try to send a nigga home, no no
 I know you wanna catch me at Sunoco

<|endoftext|>
Show me that you're loco, put holes in my photo
 Nope! Ob'

 Be-low, your grieved up people

 Bright but violent, invite the violence

Fist fight a fireman, be a tyrant
 'Til these niggas nights is silent

<|endoftext|>
O. Trice from a trife environment
 He 'Roc's the Mic' no sight of retirin'

<|endoftext|>
Who tryin' a nigga, who view's bias
 I figure your crew tired, my trigger introduces violence

<|endoftext|>
Produce them sirens, you in the 'spital, orange juice and vitamins A derelict who inherited hustle
 My heritage married the street struggle

All my life, man, I want fast cars, NASCARs
 All my life I want runway stars, Kate Moss

<|endoftext|>
As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man
 Be like my daddy's friends, hopping out that minivan

<|endoftext|>
Chrome '38s spinning like a ceiling fan
 Crying on my momma's phone swearing he a different man

<|endoftext|>
Why she wouldn't let my daddy sleep, used to see him stand
 Out in the alley through my window

<|endoftext|>
Face emotionless, I don't think they ever noticed that I noticed it
 As a kid all I wanted a hundred grand

<|endoftext|>
Ride slow, hop out, get hyphy
 Think I know why he no like me

<|endoftext|>
He broke, we know, citch
 He told, he on print

Black and white like old flicks
 We blam, he dance like Otis, I'm owed this

<|endoftext|>
Just wanna sleep without my lungs stopping, like they used to
 I hate when you lie, I hate the truth, too

<|endoftext|>
Either that or my brains to the ceiling
 Bite the bullet, tryna fight the feeling

<|endoftext|>
Write that on the grave that I get laid in
 Heaven, Hell, free or jail, same shit

Back when grandaddy died, that was a cold December

So I'm gon' hold this heat 'til they make me take my seat in prison
 Doing shit my way till 25 to life what I'm facing, baby

<|endoftext|>

 Staking out his mama house, we taking every damn thing If Illuminati buying souls and only fear was dying broke

Sidekick thefts, if he pressed him we packed him
 Ski masking, but niggas wasn't going to Aspen

Everybody telling when they go to court

I still got slaves hanging from my family tree

This little light of mine, a nine I hide inside of my drawers
 Ain't nothing Aunt Jemima, aye lil mama ain't I a star?

<|endoftext|>
I treat you faggots like I'm Tim Hardaway
 God got my Nextely, hit me if he gotta pray

<|endoftext|>
Living broke, liquor stores where we cashing checks
 Flipping dope, pimping hoes just to make ends meet

<|endoftext|>
You know who to trust, I'ma be dead long as I'm breathin'
 And if I die I keep you smilin' from the sky I don't know that girl and if I do, it's not like that

<|endoftext|>
All options open, so I keep my doors vacant
 I know that she baking, off this shit I'm making

You niggas can stick to praisin' and my niggas will stick to bangin'

Hell ain't threatening to niggas who ain't never had religion
 In this field you Phillis Wheatleys ain't gon' never catch me slippin'

<|endoftext|>
Sick of niggas, no, it ain't remission
 With it even though I hate the killings

<|endoftext|>
It's a wrap, hit his lungs if he run
 Hit his back, if he crawl, hit his hat

<|endoftext|>
I guess I'm God's gift to Hell in a funny way
 Can't wait to see my life change once the money came She said she like money, I like Hummer's, you want to trade?

<|endoftext|>
I apologize If I might be the reason that your son never made it back home
 He should have gave up the phone

 North Side, NY on my baseball cap

They be like stupid, where you been at? We ain't seen you in weeks
 Yeah, I been tryna' catch a body off of John and em' streets

<|endoftext|>
They went and killed my lil' homie so I'm back on the east
 Catch him on Anaheim and stash his mind in back of the seat

<|endoftext|>
On the highway to hell but it still ain't jail
 Gotta plug and a scale, tryna make this money

<|endoftext|>
Fuck playing by the rules, shoot him in his brain
 Life change when you take shit by the reins

<|endoftext|>
I wish a bitch would roll by on some funny shit
 Niggas know I got mines

<|endoftext|>
Late-night stepping like "Thriller", you niggas dead to me
 Tagging Seventh Street, they scrubbed it off the wall like every week

<|endoftext|>
Famous city by the sea, the streets was cold I felt the breeze
 I rose from out the ruins, broke the mold and they neglected me

<|endoftext|>
Hitting licks, them crackers cracked the whip when they arrested me
 Tell the ofays I’m doing okay

<|endoftext|>
Shawty did the Lil’ Kim, missed him but we hit his friend
 Listening to "Many Men," living out my favorite songs

 Beating the block, I'm feeding the block

<|endoftext|>
Feeding them clips, I'm the Hollow Man
 Take a nigga life, he ain't got no plans

'Til I growed, only go by the name mama gave
 Niggas sweet in the street like they're peach marmalades

Every night, on my knees I pray
 My next girl look like M.I.A

<|endoftext|>
And my enemies die like Kennedys

Niggas in the rap game tryna get slaved
 Niggas in this rap game all bitch made

 It's wavy in the beach, but nigga's crazy in the beach

<|endoftext|>
We can make a baby in the Jeep
 She's drove me crazy since "Moesha"

<|endoftext|>
But nobody's talking monetary
 Probably the reason why you never hear me I'm taking niggas bitches like Bowser

<|endoftext|>
I make the rent by making flips
 Livin' like it's '86

<|endoftext|>
I'm tryin' to sign for eighty bricks

Twelve gauge, big as a flamethrower
 I'm feelin' like Kane in Wrestlemania

 Hanging with them shady niggas in and outta prison

<|endoftext|>
I need a sixty minutes
 We leave you on the cement, we creeping, the windows tinted

<|endoftext|>
I’m one of a kind, I don’t even try
 Gunnin to shine, I’m running your mind

She icy like Isis, she shine like the mornin’
 Goddess iron ma white tee, she know I’m important

<|endoftext|>
He was a opp, so we popped cuz
 Had the vest, so we opened his top up

<|endoftext|>
I still ride around the city like I murder niggas
 Bad hoes get Roethlisberger'd

<|endoftext|>
Herring Bone chain and some skeletons, pelicans
 Rap niggas telling fibs, you ain't really selling shit

<|endoftext|>
Because I'm scared that my life will be real once I leave
 I hope God's gotta trick up his sleeve, just for me

<|endoftext|>
She asked me was I trying to rap, not fucking with that
 Just trying trap bricks, and stack chips

<|endoftext|>
Just skating, Rory Fitzpatrick
 Dope mathematics is all a nigga know

<|endoftext|>
Hopefully, they wouldn't live like they daddy did
 Ain't shit till a nigga get Grammy big

<|endoftext|>
Not the shit that you fucking with, yeah Crime Pays, you grind it takes time
 Never caught slippin so I'm sleeping with my 9

<|endoftext|>
Let me take you niggas back in the day
 When some niggas from my city claim east side pain

<|endoftext|>
Filithyz made racks off robbery
 Ain't a nigga livin' stoppin' me

<|endoftext|>
Holla' at me if you need the hands, i'll supply your need

<|endoftext|>
I don't believe anything' a nigga ever see
 The only thing that scaring me, is a better me

<|endoftext|>
When they tried to gimme ass to kiss
 I gave them automatics

<|endoftext|>
Makin' matters worse, every time I patch a verse
 Blame the FBI for the unsuspected death of mine

<|endoftext|>
I'm sorry I ain't the perfect kinda nigga
 I tried to fix it, but nobody listened so I'm chillin'

<|endoftext|>
Birds baths for your bitch ass I bring pain, watch my .45 flame
 Drive-by's, while I ghostride Cam'ron's range

<|endoftext|>
Bang like Jerome Lane, 3 or 4 K's, and a Kevlar underneath the 'Lo Chambray
 Niggas gon' try me, I'ma blast they brains

<|endoftext|>
Shotty's all I need, Cobain, coldchain
 What's rap these days? Niggas running with the police

<|endoftext|>
Nigga's want it coming off the scales and need the sales
 Pack a zip and ship it in the mail like report cards

<|endoftext|>
Just a mama and she using now Prayer couldn't save me from my sinning
 Once I seen my Granny gun I knew I had to get me one

<|endoftext|>
Couple lessons I was taught by my people coming up
 Weak niggas die in the street nigga, toughen up This ain't my first car ride with

<|endoftext|>

 No jacket when I was cold, becomin' one with my soul

<|endoftext|>
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'?
 The Devil, he busy, tryna get me everyday in every way

<|endoftext|>
Live almighty, my declaration been written
 In hieroglyphics on top of the highest mountain, now listen I tell 'em all to hail King Kendrick, resurrectin' my vengeance

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
I ain't tryna pay my way, I'm just tryna pave my way
 Mama tell me gotta save them pennies for them rainy days

<|endoftext|>
With a helmet on my head while I’m eating marshmallows
 Playing jigsaw while I’m picking off devils

<|endoftext|>
Yeah, I’m the vision, from the night I was born
 To be the eye of the tiger in the eye of the storm

<|endoftext|>
Mama still got the shakes, prayin' I'm all right
 Dreams of enemies in the lobby when they hit the lights

<|endoftext|>
More spinach, that's Popeye, four women sippin' Mai Tais

<|endoftext|>
Through it all, I came a long way
 From selling the yay, fistfights to gunplay Yeah, times is hard as it is

<|endoftext|>
I ain't tryna see the grave or the penitentiary
 Everyday living, tryna stay on my feet

<|endoftext|>
So my family can eat, I'll be damned if I see no income

 Keep your vagina in touch, dialing my line in the cut

<|endoftext|>
Hit a lick for like ten chicks
 Brought it back to the bricks then got everybody rich

<|endoftext|>
Another bite the dust like Mickey Thompson tires
 Lights flashing, niggas stunt like the grammys

No one's safe, he keeping his chrome off safety
 Headed to the function, momma's gone, they children out cussin'

<|endoftext|>
Two door seats, you know me, windows tinted so the law don't see

 My phone bleepin' and all I see is

<|endoftext|>
Can I do my shiznit? Can I be specific?
 Can I chase this grip without lookin' too big for my britches?

<|endoftext|>
Am I too prolific? The vision, my pugilistic moods insisted
 Food come from them tools, he's so choose to use

<|endoftext|>
Morphine and novacane dull the pain, still don't change the diagnos'
 Pessimistic thoughts, curin' the bricks, we tryna find some hope

<|endoftext|>

 You either chasin' this dirty money, or living righteous broke The damage is done but who's to blame? Finger pointin', namin' names

<|endoftext|>
Nobody willin' to pay that full admission to ride the gravy train
 Death is a part of life, happens daily, gotta face the pain

Can't play with these streets and say you positive, it's a contradiction
 I ain't have no pot to piss in, had to make some tough decisions

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

 And this shit gon' bounce like my shin off your dome

<|endoftext|>
Maybe I'm broken, either way I'm clinging on closely
 I know it's unhealthy, appreciate your patience

<|endoftext|>
Going hundred speed, blowin' steam, I throw a tantrum
 Judging by my face, my eyes slit like a python

<|endoftext|>
I think she might hate me for a lifetime, ayy, ayy
 Daddy cracking redrum, blueprint for the pipeline

<|endoftext|>
While they stuck on they day shift, I hate my boyfriend's fragrance

<|endoftext|>
Trying not to run out on my temper

 And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole

<|endoftext|>
Make the admission, I make like magicians and hit my Houdini
 Why they so soft like linguine? I murder this music routinely

<|endoftext|>
So I go, plague my soul
 Say I won't

<|endoftext|>
May the praise stay bad
 Ayy, Dad, Hercules want his fuckin' waves back, stay strapped (Ooh, I like that, that's right)

<|endoftext|>
Rappin' 'bout dick still, and I lease a house still

Where's Waldo, but we winnin'

<|endoftext|>
Wonder where my life went, living in the moment
 I been thinking 'bout my time spent

<|endoftext|>
Are the bills paid? Is it make-or-break? (Ugh!) Will I find a way?
 Have my feelings changed? Will I be okay? I don’t know

<|endoftext|>
But what I do know is, life don't make sense
 If you can't pay rent, so I place my bet I got cracks in my phone screen

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Hi, I live a wonderful life
 Should've died twice, wonder who on my side

<|endoftext|>
Splittin' all my problems like a Kit-Kat
 I finessed the night that we slipped up

<|endoftext|>
More like an eclipse, she couldn't miss that
 Putting my ideas where my chips at

 Homie don't play, no

 Takin' my ray, throw

<|endoftext|>

Grab a case, hideaway, fill my loads with bleach
 Couple stains ain't a game, they both hauntin' me

<|endoftext|>
Lot to say, people hate, wearin' blindfolds
 Now where did I go? Where do we go?

<|endoftext|>
Spying on your ho from a SpaceX rocket
 She wanna know why my wrist so rocky

<|endoftext|>
Howling at the moon, I'll be back in June
 Told my baby I'd be back in November

<|endoftext|>
Most thoughts, I don't think twice
 Make decisions I'll die by

<|endoftext|>
Marble floor in my brand-new crib
 This the life that I wanted still

<|endoftext|>
Ain't a day that I still been sober
 These the things that I'm tripping over Now them boys hooked on heroin

<|endoftext|>
¿Cómo se dice? Don't touch on me with them dedos
 I minimize all your credentials, I maximize all of my pesos

<|endoftext|>
Didn't want to be patient, we had to fight for this thing
 Ain't no acting complacent, the disrespect been too blatant

<|endoftext|>
Made her go home, felt the virus
 Web of life is my weed, false dreams stripped by silence

<|endoftext|>
Deals they had us sign, for years, it had mе blind
 Think I had to hit rewind and think about why I do shine

<|endoftext|>
Unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
 No peace on the street, so I'm clutchin' my heat

<|endoftext|>
I got the cash and it last 'cause I dash to the bag
 My ice white like rice, diamonds flash like the light, ayy

<|endoftext|>
Try to treat man like baby
 Feel the teeth sink in like rabies

<|endoftext|>
Depression still an uninvited guest I'm always accepting
 Can't help but meet the feeling with a familiar embrace

<|endoftext|>
Pop your biceps, cue the roid rage I think I got like five more albums inside my mind
 This that shit, that do or die, make your grandmama cry

<|endoftext|>
Barber make the texture fade, actin' out like it's charades
 Strawberry sweater fleece, baby, give me something sweet

<|endoftext|>
Like I don't know cootie
 My mama ain't raise no bitch ass

<|endoftext|>
I'll admit that
 I'm in a fetal hold, I'm a weak man

<|endoftext|>
May die before I wake
 Not the type to play

<|endoftext|>
Rearrange, reactions in my brain
 Redefine my pain

<|endoftext|>
I want a whip to call my own and a home to call my own
 All 14-15 of my niggas

<|endoftext|>
If I had to hit the brakes, I'ma stop right here
 If I had to choose, I'ma not choose you

<|endoftext|>
In the evenings when I see ’em
 I tell myself that love will be the thing to keep us from grieving

<|endoftext|>
I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody's help
 I've been lookin' after me like only I can watch my back

<|endoftext|>
Obvious why we relatin', baby, just don't keep me waitin'
 Come be my sugar, baby

<|endoftext|>
And I'm drunk as fuck, my nigga sucks up
 I need a reason to get my bucks up

<|endoftext|>
I'm saving my time for mics later
 I might save it, depending on the shit that y'all write later

<|endoftext|>
Fuck these signs, fuck these lights, put my life on the line
 When it feel right, I'm fine, no, I'm not lying, don't ask me

<|endoftext|>
I'll pay the fine, I'll pay the toll, just hope I don't crash it
 But hey, if I do, it will be a blaze of glory

<|endoftext|>
Engulfed by the manifestation of death behind me
 All my life I've felt inadequate

<|endoftext|>
Never claimed to be a saint, forgive me
 Feel like the light that I was blessed with has diminished

<|endoftext|>
Bank account move like speeds now, make it from ways to feed now
 Thinking of ways to be everything but right now

<|endoftext|>
But I might check my sight, it ain't right
 Yeah I know, but my strife overwhelms, every night

<|endoftext|>
Until I'm forced to close my eyes
 Brain disease, parasite, eating me from inside

<|endoftext|>
And watch what you're saying, and please keep praying
 'Cause niggas talk big 'til that price on their head I feel the voices always drown out all the noise in the room

<|endoftext|>
And start to wish it was you, sometimes I wish I was me
 Sometimes I'm watching my life

<|endoftext|>
I ain't afraid of the heights, they all afraid to appall
 I'm just afraid of excitement being a trip to the mall

<|endoftext|>
Don't need a dollar to dream, I need a billion in facts
 I need a trillion in wealth, y'all niggas need to relax

<|endoftext|>
Morbid reflection and stainless steel, alcohol and pills
 Deadly combinations left with nothin' else to feel

<|endoftext|>
Voids behind my eyelids, blackin' out, bleedin' out
 Silence louder than a twisted tongue lying

<|endoftext|>
Bedtime stories from purgatory, I miss you Somethin' changed in Texas, guess I missed the message
 Look, I missed my exit, I'm living like a Jetson

<|endoftext|>
I still struggle with tellin' my mom who I'm in love with
 Subtleties in between, way these diamonds gleam

<|endoftext|>
I can see my life through the window glass
 If I move with you, I don't need no cash

<|endoftext|>
Had a dream last night that she loved me back
 Keep God in my head, so a nigga bounced back

<|endoftext|>
I ain't tripping, I'm just feeling what I say
 I ain't talking, I'm just spilling from my brain

<|endoftext|>
Everybody think I got it figured out
 Chasing sanity while niggas chasing clout

<|endoftext|>
Respect my Tribe, I'm a dog like Phife (Get it?)
 You love me like a check, but my name not Nike (Get it?)

<|endoftext|>
The body is the temple, I invite spirits
 We crack riddles and giggle behind closed blinds

<|endoftext|>
Born to bleed, the brave and free
 Got needs they gotsta feed, I breathe to see defeat

<|endoftext|>
Had to take it to the streets
 Capitalistic greed plague all society like COVID-19

<|endoftext|>
Snake sneakin' I'm feeling like I'm missin'
 But never that, I'm still here bitch, so God's winnin'

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Keep you up, I come around, they stay right up on my tail
 Send me a pic whenever it slip, hoping this outflow my scales

<|endoftext|>
Human, I see through your eyes, until my CCC wide open to my skin
 They can see they run, they feel like they been kicking DDR

<|endoftext|>
I need another pill, snort and let it drip
 I'm with my white friends, we getting wasted

<|endoftext|>
Family full of athletes, I was kind of chubby
 Shit was never sunny, wrists were sorta bloody

<|endoftext|>
Need to listen to the children and the weapons they concealing
 Hear the voices of a million when I sell my first million

<|endoftext|>
I can feel the pressure, but I see my new horizons
 Me and all my niggas getting stars down on Sunset Boulevard

<|endoftext|>

 My daddy called me, said he seen my last video

<|endoftext|>
Homophobic, I tried to gangbang
 I tried to get laid, I had to get paid

<|endoftext|>
Runnin' this shit like it's a track meet
 I had to go back home, I seen too many niggas die in a week

<|endoftext|>
Only take the Jeep if my boyfriend is drivin'
 Plus he got the kinda skin that make the police like him

See the light, see the light
 All my niggas to the right, right, right

<|endoftext|>
Left, right, left, right
 You see the light, light, light, light, light, light

<|endoftext|>
Abandoned by the life-giver
 Looking back at my life different

<|endoftext|>
Fleeting moments always found a way around the frown
 Set aside the pain to celebrate the now

<|endoftext|>
I've been searchin', huntin', crawlin'
 What's it costin' me? It ain't doing much

<|endoftext|>
"I ain't listening", shit is cripplin' I got rubbers in my pocket, niggas like to gossip
 If I need to drop 'em, let me know

Sitting low on elbows, syrup on the dashboard I got a dream I'm willing to die for
 I got a team I'll commit a crime for

<|endoftext|>
Fifth string, Young Peggy Ringo (Go)
 Slick with the ink, these melodies need Duolingo (Shit)

Some of you niggas don't look well, does Peggy make you hate him?
 Is it how I make the beats sound like Poltergeist? (Huh?)

Put that on everything I love, it's been a minute, had to flip
 It's in my blood to be a stack, had to handle other business

<|endoftext|>
That's them generations chargin' the battery in my back
 See, I'm fueled by the culture, driven by my ancestors

<|endoftext|>
A hat trick, never seen a real life, realize I fantasize
 Hips sway under each breath, realize I fantasize

<|endoftext|>
My life on display, I'm always live streamin', always tweetin'
 Always doin' some shit that's gon' get me in trouble

<|endoftext|>
It's like the same damn shit every time I log on
 It's a new lame nigga that wanna see us fail

<|endoftext|>
Taking time, faking mine
 Let your hair lay on this side

<|endoftext|>
Fuckin' these niggas in Dallas (Still)
 Still think I'm bi, 'cause she will (Will)

<|endoftext|>
I'm in the back for the bitch
 She finna ride with a bitch

<|endoftext|>
No, these hoe-hoe-hoes, oh no-no-no
 She a ho-ho-ho, but her name Merlyn

<|endoftext|>
I hate the way the things I say incinerate a room
 I know I’m tryna change, that shit don't ever work

<|endoftext|>
In shit's creek of my emotions trying harder to be open
 Talking 'bout release dates, I’m trying to make it to tomorrow

<|endoftext|>
I been fucking sinning, hit the forehead
 Chest, left, right, I’m grinning, asses on the ceiling

<|endoftext|>
This is pissing off the yacht with my bitch on me
 Wearin' mink on me, sippin' Cris’ on ya

<|endoftext|>
So you ain't gotta ask me if I seen the prices
 She wanna talk (Want a deal)

<|endoftext|>
But time still tickin'
 And it's breakin' me slow, my Lord

<|endoftext|>
Seven days a week though, (all day) it's that heat, though
 My daddy called me, said he seen my last video

<|endoftext|>
I'm sorta back, I'll quarterback yo' side chick
 Hut, hut, one hike bitch, don't hide her, I'll find it

<|endoftext|>
Shawty was getting old, and she ain't know that I was cold
 And she always wanted more

<|endoftext|>
I never gave my shot, this ain't the life I chose
 You know I needed you, It's like a hundred bitches on my phone, nigga, I don’t spend the night

<|endoftext|>
But things ain't the same, I'm a different kind of nigga
 I need Broadway lights, I need eight gold figures

<|endoftext|>
I need money, keep the fame, I need pussy, keep the love
 Watered lean, it's the same, I need Jesus up above

<|endoftext|>
I need seven more days and I need forty more nights
 'Cause I don't know the right way and my mind ain't right

<|endoftext|>
All these voices on the sidelines
 Feel like doubting lies, like what's in my head

<|endoftext|>
Go fucking figure
 You might also like I woke up on tour bus

<|endoftext|>
Instead we made millions, boy I'm resilient
 Boy we made millions, boy we made millions, boy we made millions Now we ain't gotta wait 'til devil

<|endoftext|>
Dust off and I'm keepin' my pace
 I'm talkin' to wind today

<|endoftext|>
I'm selfish as fuck, I know that it's wrong
 At least I admit it, I wish that I didn't

<|endoftext|>
I been goin' every night, tryna strike gold
 We been itching' for that feelin' like a blown nose

<|endoftext|>
In the kitchen, whippin', flippin' 'til the stove blows
 Still a student, I am fluent far as prose goes

<|endoftext|>
Summertime in the back, goin' sideways
 Pack it up, stack it up by the driveway

<|endoftext|>
Caddy got white walls on it (skrr, skrrt!)
 Big daddy got ice all on me (blingin')

<|endoftext|>
I can't see the distance, I should keep it off me
 Fifth six in a foreign ceiling

<|endoftext|>
I learned the bigger the house, you know, the bigger the bills
 And like Beyoncé say, it's always bills, bills, bills

<|endoftext|>
I know my momma is good, I know my daddy is lonely
 He be holding the phone, and don't say shit when he call me

<|endoftext|>
They say they throwing three stacks, it make me feel like Andre
 I'm losing my archway, coming through the parkway

<|endoftext|>
Laugh and hold my hand, baby, when it’s convеnient
 I need me some street shit, fuck this PC shit

<|endoftext|>
Bankroll, couldn't even fold, couldn't stay afloat
 Bank broke, now I got way too many bank codes

<|endoftext|>
Sometimes I be mad that I ain't sexy
 Sometimes I be shy to show my blessings

<|endoftext|>
You remember when I used to feel like I don't understand me
 Now we speakin' the same language, I don't listen like I can be

<|endoftext|>
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
 And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole

<|endoftext|>
You might also like Oh, I'm lonesome
 And hopeless

<|endoftext|>
I been in my feelings on that island in the dirt
 I feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt

<|endoftext|>
I said I tried vacation, I tried to run away
 I deleted Facebook, I'd trade fame any day

<|endoftext|>
The topic today be the wallet
 My lady be spending, investing

<|endoftext|>
I got the cash and it last 'cause I dash to the bag
 My ice white like rice, diamonds flash like the light, ayy

<|endoftext|>
Leaving rentals in the states
 I ain't tryin' to debate, niggas dyin' out and they know I'm right

<|endoftext|>
They can try to make a plan for me, man, I'ma have to deviate
 We be stressin' but ya make

<|endoftext|>
I spill Capri-Sun when she said the price
 Fuck me right, masturbatin' to my Insta likes

<|endoftext|>
I need a white-man Mercedes, I'm a champion
 Fifty-six, the browns, two floors, one roof attached

<|endoftext|>
They tryna publicate these watered down soliloquies
 And wonder why I don't reciprocate the energy

<|endoftext|>
I'm movin' vividly, I ain't for the civility
 They check my brilliancy, uh

<|endoftext|>
Cloud above my head, hide my tears
 Hydroplane while I'm shifting gears

<|endoftext|>
I don't need you lames in my life
 Don't need fame to go shine my light

<|endoftext|>
Bigger picture ain't in your sight
 Imma paint a vision, IMAX tonight

<|endoftext|>
Sold out show, but I'm still alone
 Dress my best when I feel depressed

<|endoftext|>
Bangin' on the door like we gon' fuck it all up
 All these living means they ain't fuckin' with me

<|endoftext|>
In the chaos, I am still here I fear for my life like the president
 I'm loyal to my brothers like a- like a blood

<|endoftext|>
You forgetting how to take the trash out
 Five hoes a night the last house

<|endoftext|>
Lineups like they fresh for a flight, my whole life been glamorized
 Some dramatized, my sexuality, but baby make it sanitized

<|endoftext|>
I seen them lined up and loaded, some of the boys even look like us
 Man, I love my cup, double up

<|endoftext|>
Like how my mind sharper than a Samurai tick
 One hit of this make the sky really different

<|endoftext|>
Ran for forty nights but I sting like Cassius
 Inside her thighs, that's aurora borealis

<|endoftext|>
If I keep goin' at this rate, I'll be a great next week
 Album done in my sleep, I got it done in a week

<|endoftext|>
'Cause I ain't seen his crib still, I ain't met his kids still
 I'm tryna have a kid still

<|endoftext|>
Boys can't keep up with it
 I'm like "we shall spit it"

<|endoftext|>
I'm like both wheels spinnin'
 I'm like both Will Smith kids

<|endoftext|>
I know both Will Smith kids
 I'm so focused this is 2.0 in this bitch

<|endoftext|>
Fuck it everything in the trick straight miss ay Grey Goose
 Pull up in this bitch like niggas ain't shit

<|endoftext|>
Feel like I'm stuck in a mission
 That brings me back to the stop

<|endoftext|>
You players real in disguise
 I wash my feelings with time

<|endoftext|>
Treat my feelings like tides
 Even when I'm feeling shallow

<|endoftext|>
It's still a lake in my mind
 I think I'm drowning

<|endoftext|>
Watch the way it blooms, I can’t be removed
 Why you being dry, nigga? This a fucking cruise What’s up (With it?)

<|endoftext|>
Wakin' up, shakin', my mama hold me, she was patient
 My flight plan went from straight down to space station

<|endoftext|>
Morbid reflection and stainless steel, alcohol and pills
 Deadly combinations left with nothin' else to feel

<|endoftext|>
Voids behind my eyelids, blacking out, bleeding out
 Silence louder than a twisted tongue lying

<|endoftext|>
And these days, no license
 Only take the Jeep if my boyfriend is drivin'

<|endoftext|>
I'm psychic, the "Like Mike" kid posting my shoes still
 Too much I can't feel

<|endoftext|>
I've been feeling so sublime, yeah
 I got the number to my old phone

<|endoftext|>
But my ex is sleeping with me
 And she know I'm really busy

<|endoftext|>
I've been in my feelings on an island in the dirt
 I feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt

<|endoftext|>
I said, I'll try vacationing, I'll try to run away
 I deleted Facebook, I'll trade fame any day

<|endoftext|>
My ghost still haunt ya, my life is I, Tonya
 A big-eyed monster, only face to conquer

<|endoftext|>
Non-comprehensive, money finish sentences
 No, I ain't sensitive, nigga, just highly offended The topic today, be the wallet

<|endoftext|>
Now I get out departments, wylin'
 Why my jewelry looking like tuition to college

<|endoftext|>
I had epiphany, I wanna three-peat
 I split the wave and they glisten like

<|endoftext|>
The record's dishonest, boy, so that's why they feel me
 I'm still in this building 'til we on this motherfucker

<|endoftext|>
I keep my treatment to the sky, let my friend fly
 Feel like y'all don't notice how I peace of mind

<|endoftext|>
Eyes just side to side
 Mighta stepped, you ain't like confrontationYou might also likeEmbed

<|endoftext|>
We just some carbon based life forms spitting hydrogen
 Sometimes I wind up so the gears inside my mind will spin

<|endoftext|>
They play for paper, but I'm safer with my oxygen
 Wave like tsunami, with this proxy, everybody wins

<|endoftext|>
So it's no time for folly gotta point out all the counterfeits
 I'm counting on this gift to guide me to whatever's right within

<|endoftext|>
I build from passion, study magic, got the patent, born a patient
 Turn around like I'm Fantasia, tell them niggas that I'ma grace ya

<|endoftext|>
I trade you for a Mercedes, baby, I wonder if that chain is real
 Stop signs in disguises, man, I wonder if that pain is real

<|endoftext|>

My mind is glued to your mind (Hmm)
 I'm like, "Bitch, why you wastin' your time?"

<|endoftext|>
I'm so impatient, I know Heaven's waitin' just for Hell to raise

I need a seven to let me to glow I been in my stride, think I need an ice bath
 Hit my hot spot so I do it like that

<|endoftext|>
Mind of a predator, you know I bite back
 When my eyes stay close know I love it like that

<|endoftext|>
Straight through the vines, climb to the vines
 Ruffling the minds

<|endoftext|>
No error, just terror (One more?) Driving in silence (Ay), looking for guidance
 I lost my license, I lost control, I miss all those islands (Woo)

Swear I'm trying my hardest to keep my pride

Freeway Ricky: I'm a line kingpin
 This present moment's a divine vision

<|endoftext|>
Just to say my grace, I gotta see a priest
 Just to say my gracе, I gotta see a priest

<|endoftext|>
I said it with my chest and became a different dude
 Skrt off in the Hemi

<|endoftext|>
I've been on some other shit, ducking undercovers
 I've been running from the government, racist white Republicans

<|endoftext|>
I know they got me brainwashed, I was watching Baywatch
 "Mommy, where the colored people?" Then she lost her day job

<|endoftext|>
Had to quit my day job, I would work security
 Lyrics on my cellphone, protecting my community

<|endoftext|>
Camera lens up on my face, tell your boy to stay in place
 Reason why I love my state, let's see if the world agree Running through Elysium, I done died a hundred times

<|endoftext|>
I been having visions where I'm sipping on my last light
 Poison in the palace from the chalice of my past wife

<|endoftext|>
If I see some candids of me, it get to duffing
 If I see some candids, you ain't seen nothing

<|endoftext|>
Need to go home, everything I ever wanted I got
 Doesn't really make me happy, is this really what I wanted?

<|endoftext|>
They tell me let go, let God
 So I let go sometimes

<|endoftext|>
Flash, camera flash, I was baptized
 Never, feline, livin' nine lives

<|endoftext|>
Light, my inner light, it was multiplied
 By the holy fire of the campfire

<|endoftext|>
Ride your bitch, while you ride a bench (I'll hit you when the phone ring twice, oooh)
 I'm no pimp, but I know the steps (I'ma meet you outside, oooh)

I cannot control it
 Notice how I load it

<|endoftext|>
I cannot control it
 Notice how I load it

<|endoftext|>
'Cause you're all out thе door for me, I need a hot dog
 Causing havoc in the streets, I tell my nеighbors "pipe down!"

<|endoftext|>
I take some time, make up my mind
 And disappear, and not say shit

<|endoftext|>
Money ain’t shit when it’s meant to be
 Money just came, in this case, for me

<|endoftext|>
I'm in the streets like I'm yellow paint (Yeah)
 Wrappin' my dick with some yellow tape (Hah)

<|endoftext|>
Caddy got white walls on it (Skrr, skrrt!)
 Big daddy, got ice all on me (Blingin')

<|endoftext|>
Made her go home, felt the virus
 Web of life is my weave, false dreams stripped by silence

<|endoftext|>
Deals thеy had us sign; for years, it had me blind
 Think I had to hit rewind and think about why I do shinе

<|endoftext|>
Got my cousin doin' time, he was barely pushin' dimes
 My whole family cursed, now get the fuck out my ride See, I ain't arrogant, I promise I just know my worth

<|endoftext|>
Made my own clothes, I don't need no receipt
 'Less it's Holiday on me like I'm Jesus Tree

<|endoftext|>
See, bein' me ain't easy, it's sacrilegious
 I need assistance to maximize my existence

<|endoftext|>
Gratification instant, gratitude nonexistent I sell it by the gram, money loves my hands
 I pull a few bands out a plastic bag

<|endoftext|>
The helicopters, they fly over, I wave "hi"
 The men in red throw gang signs when I skate by

<|endoftext|>
No butterflies on the south side of the city
 All my niggas is with me, this is just the beginning I'm absentminded, intelligent, with too many thoughts

<|endoftext|>
Personify 'em in voices whenever I'm distraught
 Who's making choices inside of me when I'm feeling lost?

<|endoftext|>
Within constraints of society when it concentrates
 I'm separating inside of myself and contemplate

<|endoftext|>
See me, I need these dreams fast
 Lookin’ at me, little genius I thought I’d never make it right

<|endoftext|>
Okay to let it go
 Know everyone knows (Oh)

<|endoftext|>
Just might crash the server if we take this any further
 Bitch, I'm on point like a cursor

<|endoftext|>
I play for keeps like I'm D.O.L.L.A Dame
 Might go Hoodie Melo, Stevie Caballero

<|endoftext|>
In the evenings when I see 'em
 I tell myself that love will be the thing to keep us from grieving

<|endoftext|>
Face switch, rorschach, got different personalities
 I been off the grid lately, I been planning trips with Tavi'

<|endoftext|>
Maybe I'll find some relief, Maybe I'll find a way to break free
 From all the fucked up parts of me

<|endoftext|>
And I pack my bags to find a home
 I found that shit, don't ring my phone

<|endoftext|>
That nigga Kevin can't rap, he too sappy with his shit
 He don't rep me with his shit, he on that teenage bullshit

<|endoftext|>
I need peace for my niggas, need darker skin for all my doctors
 I like to speak like a scholar, like to think like a nigga

<|endoftext|>
Somethin' changed in Texas, guess I missed the message
 Look, I missed my exit, I'm living like a Jetson

<|endoftext|>
I still struggle with tellin' my mom who I'm in love with
 Subtleties in between, way these diamonds gleam

<|endoftext|>
Built different, this elite mental physique
 I been incubating my technique

<|endoftext|>
Still tellin' tales till the nail's in the coffin wood
 Truth tellin' lies, so you aim for the ventricles

<|endoftext|>
I been on my flashy shit like cocaine in '84
 I'll be crisp as hell like the shell of a shotty

<|endoftext|>
Y'all can keep that fifth place, want a gold trophy in my limb, baby
 Ballin' ain't for free, you gotta pay to get that

<|endoftext|>
Only talkin' numbers like it's binary code
 I need all the ones and zeros like we piloting drones

<|endoftext|>
Ain't no pretty way to paint it
 This love could rearrange it

<|endoftext|>
I'm still hanging 'round with my boys that I came with
 It's beautiful, ain't it?

<|endoftext|>
But it's no way they maintain it if it ain't organic, gain it
 No complaining in the business of obtaining what's our maintenance

<|endoftext|>
...time, I'm drinking Bacardi
 I got whiskey in my shot

<|endoftext|>
Deals they had us sign, for years, it had me blind
 Think I had to hit rewind and think about why I do shine

<|endoftext|>
Unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
 No peace on the street, so I'm clutchin' my heat (Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties)

<|endoftext|>
Sometimes I be mad that I ain't sexy
 Sometimes I be shy to show my blessings

<|endoftext|>
Now we speakin' the same language
 I don't listen like I can be

<|endoftext|>
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
 And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole

<|endoftext|>
You might also like Oh, I'm lonesome, and hopeless
 But hopeful, but hopeful

<|endoftext|>
Like when auntie couldn't decide between going to work or church
 I been in my feelings on that island in the dirt

<|endoftext|>
I feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt
 I said I tried vacation, I tried to run away

<|endoftext|>
I'll switch my place if that's good for ya Taking time, faking mine
 Let your hair lay on this side

<|endoftext|>
Can't find a silver line
 Sometimes I feel like Kurt Co-, never mind

<|endoftext|>
Now I gotta figure out how to treat ya, good (Mmm)
 Hollywood changed me maybe, this chain ain't phase me

<|endoftext|>
Made her go home, felt the virus
 And the night is like weed and false dreams mixed with signs

<|endoftext|>
Deals they had us sign, for years, it had me blind
 Think I had to hit rewind and think about why I do shine

<|endoftext|>
Unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
 No peace on the street, so I'm clutchin' my heat

<|endoftext|>
I mean, I know where my heart is
 If that's true, why I don't I feel safe in my own s— I’m a bad motherfucker, why don't you shut your mouth?

<|endoftext|>
I went to Hawaii to find myself
 Depressed as fuck, I ain't lying myself

<|endoftext|>
Messin' with Canibus is senseless
 Divide my senses by six and you'll end up with triple sixes

<|endoftext|>
‘Cause I won't be satisfied 'til I'm set
 'Til I got a triplex out in Tribeca with the skyline effect

<|endoftext|>
My fans in the street with signs tryin' to picket for this
 Saying, "We want ‘Bis! We want ‘Bis!

<|endoftext|>
Lead crusades across Europe, like the Christians for this
 The notion I'm dedicated is an understatement

<|endoftext|>
I belong on top of the pops, not on the bottom with rocks
 I mean, honest to God, I'm shocked

<|endoftext|>
That's why rhymes like mine mystify mankind
 A lot of rappers are ahead of their time

<|endoftext|>
Mad at me 'cause I kick that shit real niggas feel
 While 99% of your fans wear high heels

<|endoftext|>
Rhymes inscribed on a nickel disk encased
 In glass with an ion beam for longevity

<|endoftext|>
He claimed that he had written the greatest rhyme of all time
 But he would never take it out his archives

<|endoftext|>
Privately funded corporations carbon dated his latest creations
 To extract the information

<|endoftext|>
What is the maximum field rate application?
 The runaway glaciation surrounding the ocean basin

<|endoftext|>
I should leave this rap shit alone
 And kick my incredible rhymes in the privacy of my own home

<|endoftext|>
My imagination is my own
 The liberty to speak to freely lyrically on the microphone

<|endoftext|>
Engrave my back with the emperor's stamp
 Been spitting scientific rap since the 17th century began

<|endoftext|>
I said to myself, "Germaine, this is insane
 It's suicide, it's controlled flight into terrain"

<|endoftext|>
My style of rhymin' is ancient like Aztecs and Mayans
 Because I recognize it's all about timin'

<|endoftext|>
Me and my freestyle alliance practicin' African voodoo science
 In front of twenty-foot bonfires

<|endoftext|>
They even tried kidnappin' me, and they would've snatched me
 If their craft didn't get trapped in the Earth's gravity

<|endoftext|>
Bruisin' niggas, confusin' niggas like Chip Fu from the Fu-Schnickens
 Hit you with nuclear cruiser missiles

<|endoftext|>
Quicker than the five-speed Jamiroquai drives
 A lifespan longer than nine lives, infinite rhymes that can't die

<|endoftext|>
A nigga with a divine mind
 I dedicate this to the wise, dedicate it to dimes

<|endoftext|>
My army march a million strong
 Like the Nation of Islam with suede Timbs on

<|endoftext|>
A lyrical lynch mob shittin' on niggas
 Drawn to a hideous form with horns and a mink on

<|endoftext|>
Duckin' down low like we in 'Nam fightin' the Viet Cong
 Screamin' "Incoming!" when I see a bomb

<|endoftext|>
Shit like that supposed to be private
 I'ma fry you on behalf on Mariah and Michael

<|endoftext|>
Then start renegin' the beef, I hate peace treaties
 Forever yo' enemy I increase beef as Amityville's finest

<|endoftext|>
But that ain't nothin new, I asked your ugly crew
 They verified it, so bitch quit lyin' I remember the first time we met, I ain't even liked you

<|endoftext|>
Walkin' around my video set like you was in high school
 It must excite you seeing black people being tribal

<|endoftext|>
You ain't better than Canibus, Professor Griff, Hotep
 So Renegade Schemenegade, you pink like lemonade

<|endoftext|>
Experiments on human patients
 Can take place in several subterranean bases

<|endoftext|>
'Cause through the manipulation of certain biological agents
 They create strange creations

<|endoftext|>
Well, you need to know that this is a game
 And we're bein' betrayed and played in the worst way Yo, the Holy Script from Genesis 1:26 says

<|endoftext|>
Of where they been for the past twenty-three billion years
 Before life on the surface even appeared

<|endoftext|>
The highest professorship, my English etiquette
 Compels me to not say it if I can't spell it bitch

<|endoftext|>
My circularized third eye sees all
 Atlantis was surrounded by 4 sea walls

<|endoftext|>
Translate the English alphabet to the omega text
 Life is now and death is next

<|endoftext|>
Ayo, I stand outside the gates of Buckingham Palace sellin' reefer
 Puffing the chalice with the Beefeaters

<|endoftext|>
Canibus with the hot shit, crazy eye clique
 Niggas is bloody idiots thinkin' they can stop this

<|endoftext|>
I'm tougher than denim, lethal like venomous snake bites
 The marijuana makes my eyes bright red like brake lights

<|endoftext|>
I'm strong, my word is Bond like James
 Niggas be tryin' to test but they weak like seven days

<|endoftext|>
My style's radioactive, massive, atomic
 I plan to push the Earth in front of Halley's Comet

<|endoftext|>
Then I take the green, buy a automobile machine
 For that thing on page forty-three in Jet Magazine

<|endoftext|>
While I be in the lab composing forbidden scriptures
 So wicked, I got Satan ejaculating on his fingers

<|endoftext|>
Like Dirk Diggler in the middle of Boogie Nights
 Sniffin' white, living the hype, he ruined his life

<|endoftext|>
I dream quasi-Draconian dreams when I sleep
 Peyote leaves mixed with the blood of a priest

<|endoftext|>
It's the optical stimuli of watching men cry
 I hope I've got time to repent before I die

<|endoftext|>
Phase shifting to 45°
 I'm too crooked to see, I memorize the books that I read

<|endoftext|>
Try to visualize what Harry Houdini was feeling
 Handcuffed underwater without breathing

<|endoftext|>
Count how many mics I smoke minus the G.O.A.T
 'Bus is dope, my battling average higher than most

<|endoftext|>
When I'm on the mic I release fire from throat

Too much Oxy in my body, I don’t know if I can take it
 Everything is in slow motion, like I'm stuck inside the matrix

Run away from my insecurities, I feel evasive
 Sometimes I look at my past, and wish that I could just erase it

Mama praying when I'm walking the streets
 Cause they boys on the corner keep calling police

<|endoftext|>
A street nigga ny know
 I drink rosay like a fucking whino

 Fuck a cd I'm bagging up that work

<|endoftext|>
The ak is like a pogo stick
 I put holes in a rat on some popo shit

<|endoftext|>
See my roof is invisible my life is great
 When I die my kids got millions in my pshycial traits

<|endoftext|>
Cause I'm killin every nigga in sight like buck shots
 Nigga run up on me think my chin is glass

<|endoftext|>
Cause I rap nigga I ain't fooled

<|endoftext|>
Play mean you fool, fool mean we eat
 Your face on the shirt, you six feet-feet deep

<|endoftext|>
My Murda Mook a nigga, that mean my bars is mean

<|endoftext|>
Sippin' Malibu loungin' in the Malibu Mountains
 Now we livin' straight no more Section 8 Housing

<|endoftext|>
Fingers all sticky off that pink cotton candy
 Sexin' on the beach where its hot and sandy

<|endoftext|>
Yo, I used to ride in hoopties now my nuts in models mouth
 After the movies and a meal from Waffle House

<|endoftext|>
You think cause I rap, shit is peaches and cream?
 Well, I'm still in the hood selling pieces to fiends

<|endoftext|>
Eight-paved forty-eight got my mind in orbit
 We refuse to forfeit, we beat life challenges

<|endoftext|>
My life is too fast I wished it moved in slow motion
 Haters wanna see me ashy with no perry lotion

<|endoftext|>
Money ain't a thing six figure pinky ring
 My eyes chinese I'm on point like Lin

<|endoftext|>
With a mean bitch my money is Illuminati
 I sacrifice it for some millions and a Maserati

<|endoftext|>
20 rozays in an icebowl
 Confetti fallin out the sky like the rose bowl

<|endoftext|>
You a king, I'm Achilles, roll up the Phillies
 I behead a nigga with the semi Real niggas comin' home, wonder what they missin'

<|endoftext|>
I slide in a blackberry milasis
 Roll the cherry pie now I'm high like nasa

<|endoftext|>
I'm burning money like Mayweather
 Steve Jobs 6 feet deep with more than 6 figures I'm rich, bitch I'm on my rich ass shit

<|endoftext|>
I ain't keeping this, I'm mistreating it
 My 3 baby mama must be on this shit

<|endoftext|>
Then I'm a ring some leafs
 Bitches what I'm seeing be

<|endoftext|>
So her mouth is now my fountain
 If she pounding then we bouncing

<|endoftext|>
Ain't nothin but clarity on my scale
 Addicts feel the agony popping pills

<|endoftext|>
I wake hungover from the other night
 Brush my teath Fuck spending, I spent Friday in the kitchen

<|endoftext|>
I'm a real nigga, and I always been
 Selling by the brick, spending by the ten

<|endoftext|>
I make a movie like a actor with squid packs
 That quick get back revenge is like some good cash I take a nigga head off, like a hot mascot

<|endoftext|>
4-5 leave real big blood stain
 Bang yourself like prince did in purple rain

<|endoftext|>
My homie locked behind them owensville walls
 I press 3 and accept the call

<|endoftext|>
Now that everybody tryna crowd around a nigga style, like a nigga style
 But they holier than thou

<|endoftext|>
I'm like a magnet, I keep attractin' rappers that's in need of a master kind of like sensei
 So let them bow they heads and begin to pray

<|endoftext|>
Survivin' my rhymes is highly uncommon
 All them niggas think I be wrong but I come to pause in my prime, it’s time to pay homage

<|endoftext|>
Even when I lean with it I-I'm clean with it
 I am the illest nigga niggas have seen with it, supreme with it

<|endoftext|>
So why in the fuck is they actin' like we ain't the reason that everything changed?
 Way back in the days well, it came from East 99, the beast, they deny me

<|endoftext|>
Heat, so heated heavy that these competitors are never ready
 I'm like a disease, I keep spreadin'

<|endoftext|>
I hit 'em like a headache or a migraine, watch a nigga die in the flames when I set it, deadly
 Burn them to Hades, and learn 'em that Krayzie, ain't never afraid, who scared?

<|endoftext|>
So I got 'em on a choke hold, lung they ass like the po-po
 And that’s when I'm solo, go low

<|endoftext|>
Destined to shine since I was born
 Defies the mind how I ride this strong They told me they wanna hear music

<|endoftext|>
'Cause I love my music, my creative juices run like fluid
 Kind of like Nike shoes, I just do it

<|endoftext|>
When I get in to my mode, it's flow mo'
 When the niggas off the road, they so slow

<|endoftext|>
So niggas duck get to splitting and divide
 Because the flow is divine and is designed to hit 'em in the mind, get me on the grind

<|endoftext|>
I’m infecting 'em young like rabies
 I’m an epidemic, I’m outrageous

<|endoftext|>
You might also like Still in the race, I’m maintainin' my lead
 Call me speedy Gonzales, I come with the speed

<|endoftext|>
The last man standin', microphone bandit
 Niggas can't stand it, that's how I planned it

<|endoftext|>
And anybody goin' against me don't win
 So think about it, goin' against me? No sense

<|endoftext|>
And it originated from the baddest, sinister, maddest
 Lyrically certified, it ain't to many niggas that ain't heard of mine

<|endoftext|>
With my murderous vibe, I'll merc your minds, search and find
 Kray Jack on a level and I fly by like hot metal

<|endoftext|>
Cause now we barely make it, day to day we can't escape it
 So the only way to face it altogether is to take it

<|endoftext|>
Too late to try to interpret the writing on the wall and
 It's way too late, to pray, you too late - tribulation too great for you to escape it (escape)

<|endoftext|>
Won't even listen to these weirdos in their weird clothes
 Let's make it clear, hoe, we don't speak the queer code

<|endoftext|>
They like, is this really Kray? I hate to be offensive, but fuck you, if you offended
 If you feeling defensive then, bitch get up and defend it

<|endoftext|>
Never met any contender, never been no pretender
 So remember, you don't know me, nigga

<|endoftext|>
Checking niggas up off the hit list
 Spray them bitches with this shit

<|endoftext|>
9 to 5 won't slow down til my money right
 I'm tryna live a little with the sunny bright lights

<|endoftext|>
And I admit a nigga loving quite nice
 I'm addicted to living at a high price

<|endoftext|>
So I'm tempted to risk it with my life
 I'm straight through the day but then by night

<|endoftext|>
I'm on the grind and my mind in the twilight
 I go the hardest, comin' like a snarling bull when I'm charging

<|endoftext|>
But when they awake and they see I was real
 And leathaface still in the building

<|endoftext|>
Just follow your nose, nose, nose
 It always know, know, know

<|endoftext|>
You smell the dro inhale the blow, go tell some mo, mo, mo
 We got some flotion potion thats gone fold you open up

<|endoftext|>
Finna show 'em how to flow when I pour a lil mo' drinkie, drink off in my cup
 I still take a lil' Hen mix it with a lil Gin

<|endoftext|>
Thinkin' they not, easy to drop
 Nigga, y'all can believe it or not

<|endoftext|>
Better get up off me, I'm a really crabby nigga
 If I gotta release it, I guess I gotta be a killa

<|endoftext|>
Everybody wanna know if Krayzie comin' wit' it
 Got a nine I'll make 'em feel it, if ya really think I'm bullshittin'

<|endoftext|>
With a mystic mind, I come with the wicked and rip the rhyme
 The rhythm is leavin em hypnotised

<|endoftext|>
They really been missin the Gemini, feel the vibe, real am I
 Unstoppable, takin a loss ain’t optional

<|endoftext|>
You be the victim and I’ll be inflictin ya lyrical PAIN
 This bullet’s addictin, give em the fixin

<|endoftext|>
Reefer really makes me happy, and it makes me see
 Every puff that I breath

<|endoftext|>
We got the cheesy
 We need to know if you can show me the nigga with the weedy

<|endoftext|>
Nigga, let's do in the enemy now
 Terminate, eliminate 'em

<|endoftext|>
No kind like I, gemini, gotta control both sides
 My lordy lord maintain, hard, 'cause I'm a soldier at war

<|endoftext|>
Invading, they creepin, sneakin, tryina catch me sleeping
 Awakened; I'm steady runnin, tryina get away

<|endoftext|>
I don't know why, suckers keep hatin my grind (My grind-grind)
 But they can never stop a nigga risin (Risin)

<|endoftext|>
I'm a real (real) ill (ill) rider (Rider, rider)
 Living truth, I'm a true ghetto survivor ('vivor)

<|endoftext|>
Get out that slave mentality, mayn!
 If it's vain, it's got to be bane

<|endoftext|>
The crime is raising, so the nines keep blazin
 Nations can't save us and everybodies anxious

<|endoftext|>
We gonna (??) crazy and i'm silent until I slip into my other mode
 We front the underland understand, understand?

<|endoftext|>
Lock and I load the flow
 Cock and unload my glow

<|endoftext|>
Singing most subliminal, oh no
 As if a nigga really don't know

<|endoftext|>
Still I pack that steel, still will blast it
 I'm back and I'm giving 'em what they've been missing

<|endoftext|>
Hit 'em with a hypnotizing tone
 I'm ready to fight and deny my throne

<|endoftext|>
Go home cause you don't want it
 So many niggas that try to get with it but they never make it, they fall

<|endoftext|>
I'm taking it higher, they ain't on my level, Kray Jack ain't got time to be dealing with y'all
 Still the killa (Still the killa)

<|endoftext|>
Sometimes I can't eat, I can't think, I can't sleep
 And I really can't believe I'm tweakin, cuz this ain't me

<|endoftext|>
She givin me a reason I should lead the way, she
 Keep feelin how she really not about to play me

<|endoftext|>
I still can't seem to meet these 'ends, this ain't workin (Workin)
 I'm hurtin while everybody keep eatin off mine (Eatin off mine)

<|endoftext|>
They try do dictate my days, they don't pay
 It's crazy that the paper don't weigh like my fame

<|endoftext|>
Cause see I really never sleep, in fatigue-
 Got the heat in the stash (In the stash-in the stash-in the stash)

<|endoftext|>
Running with the AK-47
 Niggas trying to survive they ain't trying to go to heaven

<|endoftext|>
Motherfuckers shooting they ain't even asking questions it's these
 Young ass niggas they straight up thugged out

<|endoftext|>
The mission is to make money
 The enemy the police

<|endoftext|>
Bad breaks and heartaches
 Give and take, shake and bake

<|endoftext|>
G'd as fuck gangstafied
 High as the sky, gangsta for life

<|endoftext|>
Heat a nigga in the streets with a gotdamn beat my heat lose to me
 Khakis suits and fatigues

<|endoftext|>
But now I realize I try to climb up from the bottom, my enemies
 See they hating me

<|endoftext|>
Industry underrated me
 Hennessy made me think retaliation

<|endoftext|>
Patiently waiting my desperation
 Keepin me deep in my meditation

<|endoftext|>
But then I realize
 You might also like I try to give warning

<|endoftext|>
Minds are blinded
 These times remind me

<|endoftext|>
I do well try to save mine
 They choosing not to see the light

<|endoftext|>
I'm livin' life and I'm learnin' from all the experience that has been given to me
 Now I see how it be really inside of the industry

<|endoftext|>
Lessons I've learned, blessings I've earned, I can clearly see it
 And I can feel it, it's real and I live it

<|endoftext|>
Maintain, tryna stay sane
 It's an exhaustin' grind

<|endoftext|>
Life lessons, I graduated to a much higher class
 Try myself traveling down a much brighter path

<|endoftext|>
The tuners, the rulers of it all
 So every day I'm alive, I celebrate the hella crazy, I defeated my odds

<|endoftext|>
Ain't it crazy
 Jump inside and see my side, it was crazy

<|endoftext|>
No gas or water, had to borrow H2O from my relative
 Man, it feels like I ain't even here

<|endoftext|>
But the devil won't settle, fuckin up my levels he won't let go
 I'm living to die it seems I just can't win

<|endoftext|>
Now I'm high, but I'm stopping to realize I drunk this whole fifth of Gin
 (Nigga damn!) I'm 17 and drinking like I'm grown up

<|endoftext|>
I got some problems, plus I need some money
 And it's really all because... Juvenile nigga done struggling, hustling, struggling like I want it

<|endoftext|>
Then fuck school, right now I'm hungry, and I can't eat that damn diploma
 But on this corner I can eat every day, all I gotta do is slang this yay

<|endoftext|>
Nigga, If business keep going this way me and my family is fin to be straight
 I'm glad I took that fifty dollars that grandma gave me

<|endoftext|>
Hate to say it, but I think these streets done really created a monster
 Cause now that I see how quick I can come up by breaking the law

<|endoftext|>
And if I don't play the crook, you ain't gonna have shit on your books, look
 "Gimme a minute, I'll chill in a minute I promise I will

<|endoftext|>
Baby, I still believe (Still believe)
 And it's more than my imagination

<|endoftext|>
Won't go insane
 I figure that's why they be callin' me Krayzie 'cause I still maintain

<|endoftext|>
But these demons got me seeing things that's really been misleading me
 Maybe that's just my life

<|endoftext|>
It ain't no reason, -reason
 Reason to stop your believin', -lievin'

<|endoftext|>
I still believe in keepin' it real enough to achieve it
 I still believe simply just 'cause I still believe it

<|endoftext|>
Niggas really think i'm carin'
 What they sayin' like they scarin' me

<|endoftext|>
Stay strapped these days cause i don't know who to trust
 So I just point my gun everywhere when I bust

<|endoftext|>
So don't act like i'm hiding
 Nigga, y'all are just some scary-hoes Why niggas be actin' like they know me?

<|endoftext|>
I'm on the front line
 I love mine

<|endoftext|>
And any nigga trying to get up in my way
 Might i say, them bitches beggin' for a beatin'

<|endoftext|>
I wake up and I can see the sun shining
 And the bright blue sky, natural high I'm vibing (Vibing)

<|endoftext|>
Steady rising watch me elevate, to the clouds and levitate
 I ain't even walking; I'm glidin' (glidin')

<|endoftext|>
I see the police but they speed on pass me
 Didn't even harasse me, waved at me, that was classic (man)

<|endoftext|>
They say the Mexican, and black man, is decked in? (then alright)
 White pride co-insides with the African (Man)

<|endoftext|>
That coldness inside me, but I ain't trying to hurt nobody
 Temptation is keeping me steadily going under

<|endoftext|>
And now I'm like, Help me Lord, to better my life, my life
 Just give me the chance to prove the world that I can be the man that I am

<|endoftext|>
I've seen much in my time and I think it was too much for my eyes
 The wickedness pulling me closer to failure everytime I think I'm rising, yeah

<|endoftext|>
I can see how I've been sinnin
 I'm asking the Lord for a little bit of forgiving, 'giving

<|endoftext|>
(Why do I stay high?)
 2Pac, Eazy, Biggie Biggie, everybody

 (The higher I get the further I get away) Acting crazy

<|endoftext|>
Sick of living in this material world
 Times done changed the grind is getting critical

<|endoftext|>
Everybody wanna ball, (they want it all)
 Be the boss with nice cars and floss just like stars

<|endoftext|>
Anxiously, trying to flipin' get a grip on my mind
 No more strippin' no more slippin' my God

<|endoftext|>
No matter what I try to fight for my life
 And even if I die I, I got by at least I made it in this cold cold world

<|endoftext|>
Formulate a different tactic, let's sing anthems
 No stereotypical categorizing, rising above all make shift realities

<|endoftext|>
Stay still, please don't move your soul you could lose
 No crying, where's my blood?

<|endoftext|>
So I had to dash, ran upstairs I was frantic and panicked

But my decisions make a scurry, I live in a hurry
 Im plenty worried i can lose my soul, if i dont start acting like im supposed to know (better!)

<|endoftext|>
Sometimes i feel like i might not live past the storm
 Seem like its been forever and forever just keeps passing on

<|endoftext|>
Distracted by the bright lights and diamonds
 Everybody wants the nice life, reclining

<|endoftext|>
Put the design in motion get it (organized)
 Just like I'm blindly focused and a hater can't brake my stride

<|endoftext|>
So the light stay shine as I take flight
 Get it early in the morning and then a brake night

<|endoftext|>
Live out my life I can never take light
 And all of my wrongs I can never make right

<|endoftext|>
When I flow like fluid and I blow like stupid
 And it's all so fluent and I go so tourie

<|endoftext|>
So cold, I freeze any MC thinkin' he hot
 Show him the reason why he not as sick or slick as he thought

<|endoftext|>
Got atomic bomb spit

<|endoftext|>
Afraid that they mistaken that they thinkin Kray ain't hip, hip, hip

I'm still the same baby
 Lady gotta make it, I can't be takin' no losses

<|endoftext|>
So paranoia got me sleepin' on the floor, watchin' the door

<|endoftext|>
And anyway you go we won't make it
 No way, to shake, fake it

<|endoftext|>
I keep a rhythm in the holster, but lyrics in the chamber
 So step a little closer, approach the danger

Never seen a nigga kill a nigga with a rhythm like me

<|endoftext|>
Shoot up your posse, You're dealin with trill niggas
 If it comes to it real killas

<|endoftext|>
On the road to this meal ticket
 My pistol is still with me, them lyrics is still wicked

<|endoftext|>
With my remige, Thugline team, coming to kill something
 Close to 30 million sold and still thuggin, still strugglin

<|endoftext|>
For most of them niggas they want peace when we meet
 Like we ain't be hearin what they be saying on the streets

<|endoftext|>
A couple a months done passed me up a nigga still sitting
 I'm stuck in the system and the judge still tripping, listen

<|endoftext|>
Looking at these steel walls, driving me nuts
 That's why I jump up every time they shut

<|endoftext|>
Inside my mind there's like a real loud silence
 Isolation got me consumed (just like my mood got me consumed)

<|endoftext|>
And I'm not tryna fight right now, I'm not gon' pretend
 That I'm not really high right now, my mind's in the wind, I'm gone

<|endoftext|>
I might reply to myself
 'Cause I rely on myself

<|endoftext|>
Everybody act friendly but it's really misleading
 So deceiving, I feel it, I'm from Cleveland, I live it

<|endoftext|>
That I'm not really high right now, my mind's in the wind, I'm gone
 They talking to me but I step back in the zone

<|endoftext|>
I rise but my name's not Mya
 And I's a tight female, don't need to smoke to get you higher

<|endoftext|>
And be the one who peeping out them player haters in the back
 And I'm attacking -tacking, yes and I'm relaxin' when I'm high

<|endoftext|>
But my mentality can't be faded; I play it so fucking smooth
 I got my mind just like chess and I concentrate on every move

<|endoftext|>
I'm making my G's, them niggas asleep
 But I don't care if they wake up

<|endoftext|>
Maintain, sustain a Krayzie grind
 I play the field so nigga I keep it real, no lie

<|endoftext|>
Leave in line, the ass-whippins with extra clips
 Clips with my nigga Krayze Bone with some thugged-out shit

<|endoftext|>
Put it down in the street for mine
 24/7, stayin on the grind

<|endoftext|>
Y'all niggas always testing, gonna make me pull this weson
 If money ain't the answer rephrase the question, dawg

<|endoftext|>
Real niggas don't lie, hit 'em in the mind
 Everytime goddamn we live

<|endoftext|>
Thrill niggas, we'll kill niggas if they wanna kill me
 Still runnin with the AK-47 , ain't shit changed

<|endoftext|>
And I ain't really trippin of these niggas
 They say they gonna get me, yet they miss me (what?)

<|endoftext|>
Strugglin is in my blood so I'm pissin' out hard time (alright!)
 Now where can I shine, nigga?

<|endoftext|>
And I'm still on my grind
 Nigga I'll put this on my kids

<|endoftext|>
But, nigga, late-lay
 I been feelin like niggas really been tryin' to play Kray

<|endoftext|>
Haters hatin hard
 Because da way I play my cards

<|endoftext|>
Krayzie scrape the yard
 And I'm takin it all just like I hitcha hard and kill em

<|endoftext|>
Game, I been on the the running before I recognize game
 I see it coming and keep pushin' my way, stay sucka free if I can I don't even want dem haters to even shake my hand

<|endoftext|>
Sick of living in this material world
 Times done changed the grind is getting critical

<|endoftext|>
Everybody wanna ball (they want it all)
 Be the boss with nice cars & floss just like stars

<|endoftext|>
Anxiously, trying to flippin' get a grip on my mind
 No more strippin' no more slippin' my God

<|endoftext|>
No matter what I try to fight for my life
 & even if I die I, I got by at least I made it in this cold cold world

<|endoftext|>
Beware the lyrical misfit
 Prepare for critical quick spit

<|endoftext|>
They don't really make it like this way anymore
 These niggas done so men atinchons ignored

<|endoftext|>
Look i got a life and a wife twice as nice
 And she sacrifice for Christ so take a hike trick

<|endoftext|>
You might also like I ain't looking for no mistress miss
 I'm not gonna promise ya expensive gifts

<|endoftext|>
But then we wake up in the middle of the night gimme a light
 Ya body is lying so close to mine the feeling is right

<|endoftext|>
So faded elated we made it through another day of lame shit
 Just blaze it we shaking them haters on that same shit

<|endoftext|>
Put it down in the street for mine
 24/7, stayin on the grind

<|endoftext|>
Fuckin 'em up, scream "fuck the world" while I cuff my nuts
 Real niggas don't lie, hit 'em in the mind, everytime goddamn we live

<|endoftext|>
Thrill niggas, we'll kill niggas if they wanna kill me
 Still runnin with the AK-47 ain't shit changed

<|endoftext|>
'Fore the motherfuckin piper pay the bitch You motherfuckas feelin to feel it
 Thugline put it down keepin it the real it

<|endoftext|>

 They say they gonna get me yet they miss me

<|endoftext|>
Why you always nagging?
 Make a nigga wanna take a seat, I can't stand it

<|endoftext|>
Messin up my mode, killin off my mood
 I feel like you should go but I hate to be rude (No I don't)

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Let's elevate, Smoke out and levitate
 I need to meditate, on how yo man can make

<|endoftext|>
A plan to generate, A couple Benny Franks
 That ghetto wine got my mind, Now i'm high (high)

<|endoftext|>
I'm still broke, but, I feel fly (fly)
 Don't want this like the end so we gon' all pitch in (pitch in)

 Y'all reppin just steppin, I'm only playin to win

<|endoftext|>
What we be givin?
 Heat from the kitchen when fuckin with this shit

<|endoftext|>
Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm

<|endoftext|>
Of pain, I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
 Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme

<|endoftext|>
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
 I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes

<|endoftext|>
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
 Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks

<|endoftext|>
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
 I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's

<|endoftext|>
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
 I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane

<|endoftext|>
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
 Inhale deep like the words of my breath

<|endoftext|>
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
 Y'all some well-wishin' (Bitch niggas), friendly-actin', envy-hidin' snakes

<|endoftext|>
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
 In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building

<|endoftext|>
And my mentality is money-orientated
 I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it

<|endoftext|>
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
 Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high

<|endoftext|>
'Cause life's a bitch and then you die I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin'
 The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and

<|endoftext|>
My physical frame is celebrated 'cause I made it
 One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created

<|endoftext|>
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
 Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage

<|endoftext|>
I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged, then
 Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin

<|endoftext|>
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
 Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'

<|endoftext|>
Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep
 I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep

<|endoftext|>
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
 I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home

<|endoftext|>
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
 Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip

<|endoftext|>
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
 Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom

<|endoftext|>
The crew is lampin' Big Willie style
 Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild

<|endoftext|>
Antera spinnin' on millenniums
 20 G bets I'm winnin' 'em, threats I'm sendin' 'em

<|endoftext|>
Lex with TV sets the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
 Party with villains, a case of Demi-Sec

<|endoftext|>
I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
 Across the street you was wildin'

<|endoftext|>
Talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89
 Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine

<|endoftext|>
I cocked the baby 9, that nigga grave be mine
 Clanked him—what was he thinkin'?

<|endoftext|>
Somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
 Then they came askin' me my name

<|endoftext|>
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
 I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped?

<|endoftext|>
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
 Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'

<|endoftext|>
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
 Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'

<|endoftext|>
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
 Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic

<|endoftext|>
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
 Jam like a TEC with correct techniques

<|endoftext|>
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
 End like Leviathan, it's deep? Well, let me try again

<|endoftext|>
Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
 I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles

<|endoftext|>
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
 Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot

<|endoftext|>
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
 MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak

<|endoftext|>
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
 He might beat his case, 'til he come home I'll play it lowkey

<|endoftext|>
So stay civilized, time flies
 Though incarcerated your mind dies

<|endoftext|>
Hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
 A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone

<|endoftext|>
Only 12, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style
 Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes

<|endoftext|>
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
 And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze

<|endoftext|>
I take a glimpse into time
 Watch the blimp read "The World Is Mine" The way to be: Paradise life, relaxin'

<|endoftext|>
Open they eyes to the lies, history's told foul
 But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child

<|endoftext|>
Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling
 Tricking six digits on kicks and still holding

<|endoftext|>
Trips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage
 Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish

<|endoftext|>
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
 Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight

<|endoftext|>
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
 Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer

<|endoftext|>
Still, nobody want a nigga having shit
 If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit

<|endoftext|>
The fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
 Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em

<|endoftext|>
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
 That depends, carry MAC-10s to practice my aim

<|endoftext|>
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
 Dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros

<|endoftext|>
Making choices that determine my future under the sky
 To rob, steal or kill, I'm wondering why

<|endoftext|>
I'm like beef, busting heat through your windows
 I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather

<|endoftext|>
I'm like all races combined in one man, like the '99 Summer Jam
 Bulletproof Hummer man

<|endoftext|>
‘Cause I'm a ace when I face the bass
 40-side is the place that is givin' me grace

<|endoftext|>
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
 And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds

<|endoftext|>
Nasty Nas has to rise ‘cause I'm wise
 This is exercise 'til the microphone dies

<|endoftext|>
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
 Versatile, my style switches like a faggot

<|endoftext|>
Am I in place with the bass and format?
 Explore rap and tell me Nas ain't all that

<|endoftext|>
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
 Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild

<|endoftext|>
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
 Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it

<|endoftext|>
But chill, pass to Andre, and let's slay
 I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinée

<|endoftext|>
Sentence begins indented with formality
 My duration's infinite, money-wise or physiology

<|endoftext|>
It's real, grew up a trife life, the times of white lines, the high pipes
 Murderous night times and knife fights invite crimes

<|endoftext|>
Here's my basis; my razor embraces many faces
 You're telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces

<|endoftext|>
Peoples are petro, dramatic automatic .44 I let blow
 And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so

<|endoftext|>
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
 I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real

<|endoftext|>
Aristocrats, politickin' daily wit' diplomats
 See, me, I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche

<|endoftext|>
My destiny's to be the new boss
 A nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft

<|endoftext|>
I chill wit' niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
 My red beam made a dread scream, and sprayed a Fed team

<|endoftext|>
You might also like Yo, my mind is seein' through your design like Blind Fury

And push cakes inside the casket at Just' wake

<|endoftext|>
And now the projects is talkin' that somebody-gotta-die shit
 It's logic — as long as it's nobody that's in my clique

<|endoftext|>
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
 I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times

<|endoftext|>
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
 That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down

<|endoftext|>
Like a princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
 Plus she's seen me switchin' women, Pops was on some pimp shit

<|endoftext|>
Her mother cried when she answered
 Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted

<|endoftext|>
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
 When she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed-off

<|endoftext|>
I be tryin' to reply and they never suppose I get my quiet time in?
 They think forever I’m rollin' in dough, swimmin' in a pool of cash

<|endoftext|>
I had to tell homes, I don’t keep a cell phone, my bad
 I drag off the L and try to silence it

<|endoftext|>
Pour my Pinot Grigio and Cris' with some lime, what is this?
 An immaculate version of "Me & My Bitch" by Biggie

<|endoftext|>
Military hat, fatigue pants saggin', Henny'd up
 Execs askin' will he live to see his own release date happen

<|endoftext|>
Nigga I tried and niggas threw that shit right back in my face
 They took my cosign, but they ain't let me EP their tapes

<|endoftext|>
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
 Ice that I wear, flows that I try

<|endoftext|>
Close your eyes, picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin'
 Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya

<|endoftext|>
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
 Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater

<|endoftext|>
Friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights
 Hell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come

Jamming up the border to this game stop, and I side with the Lord
 Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors

<|endoftext|>
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
 Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks

<|endoftext|>
So some are E (Summary), which reminds me of "Rap Summary," mami
 My theme song, me and "P" always used to play that shit on repeat all day

<|endoftext|>

 Me, I'm free of debt, yeah, green is on Chia Pet (Woo)

<|endoftext|>
Yeah, and this shit ain't for the faint
 'Cause the brain's illa trained killer, danger, deranged

<|endoftext|>
Simultaneously making me climb higher
 Heinous crimes behind me, search but can't find me

<|endoftext|>
Rocking Roberto Cavalli, no shirt on, convertible Mazi
 My Colombiana mommy riding beside me

<|endoftext|>
Every tat mean something, that’s my word on my body

Make me think what the hell they clean they syringes with
 Everybody bleeding, the cops are the demons

 And I say it's quite amazing

 Scientists say we ain't prepared

Everybody lyin' telling stories backwards
 Like my song Rewind, in store autographin'

To take it back in time to today, I'm smashin'
 Flick out ashes, flip girls on a mattress

<|endoftext|>
Town house niggas
 I'm six cribs deep, six bank accounts in six countries

<|endoftext|>
I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
 Came from behind the sun, my hands balled in a fist

<|endoftext|>
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
 Twitching 'cause I'm nervous, though my intended purpose

<|endoftext|>
They washed me off and he say, "At least that nigga ain't ugly"
 Placed me in his arms snugly, laid me on my mother

<|endoftext|>
Buckets like Gilligan
 Still I peep reptilians in the Filligan

<|endoftext|>
Yet to see any heavyweight make it to this round
 This that pure champion sound, I wear the crizzown

Pushin' a 5 B-Y me up in the passenger seat
 But I see me as Hallie Selassie in my kingdom

Sippin' Asti Spumante, driftin', reality kicks in
 I need the papes to start clickin'

<|endoftext|>
Some I paid college fees, then they strip tease
 And it's sad I don't remember great times that made me drool

Imagination is what they lack
 It stops niggas from getting stacks

Pumpin Sade, my head nod
 Finally I met the perfect bitch, pardon my French

The game, will put niggas in they grave
 Right before they part ways, with the street

 Spilled Pepsi on the cuflings, ginger ale got it out

<|endoftext|>
How much money's enough? Think maybe like a trillion figures
 Pray my daughter don't wild like the Hilton sisters

<|endoftext|>
Billion dollar dream head, went from triple beams to digitals
 Servin' fiends to minimal, sixty G's

<|endoftext|>
After they eat so they can stay lightweight
 Swallowin' my protein like an Ovaltine shake

<|endoftext|>
Terry-cloth robes, elegance, movie shit
 Heated-up marble floors with jacuzzis in it

<|endoftext|>
You know the money, blues, blunts, broken 22's
 Monkey see, monkey do, shorty sipping sunny dew

<|endoftext|>
Now it's V.S.O.P. in a Phantom, mad smoky
 Murder trees, cruising gat in the stash so it won't poke me

<|endoftext|>
Tilt the dutch, twisted up the uwee if you're skilled enough
 In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili busts To the hood, may this be the day that we pop them bottles

<|endoftext|>
So hustlers make crack sales cause they deprived and hungry
 My country hates that I could run free state to state with hunnies

While making cake with real golded plate rims on Humvees
 The bush stroker, the kush smoker, nigga

 Wish it could be more, pray I beat the court cases

<|endoftext|>
And I'm late to a date with my wife, I realize
 I stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise

<|endoftext|>
New woman, she's great, this a different world
 Checking out my wife's chemistry with my little girl

It's so amazing, playing, life is so crazy
 I'm grown up and thankful for lessons God gave me

<|endoftext|>
Your game's over
 Crossed the warpath of a brave soldier

<|endoftext|>
Fire spitter, I ain't never met a higher nigga
 Me extinguished is like Queensbridge fiendless

<|endoftext|>
Young niggas try to keep up with what I'm doing
 D cups, tequila and blunts

<|endoftext|>
Glad to see you made it home to the hood, nigga
 We blowing trees, tell me, don't it feel good, nigga? Another bullet manufactured, another man in his casket

<|endoftext|>
When I attack I'm faceless like a iron mask
 They get away quick, traceless, lying back, liars pass

<|endoftext|>
Stretched out or in a body bag, I ain't that
 Live young, obtain wisdom, and die last

<|endoftext|>
Not bothered if my son and daughter eat off of me
 Cautiously I write this next line honestly 'cause I'm a G, there's no beef

<|endoftext|>
TMZ, they hoping when the marriage end I'ma turn to Larry Flynt

Bandages on my finger, still managing chords
 Like a live band, performing in a sand storm

<|endoftext|>
Blind, but I still hit the right keys
 Swift as a life breeze, dripping

So I smoke the finest, (85 for the ocean liners?)
 I do it for the have-not's, I'm at spot

<|endoftext|>
Face it, my favorite trinket was that Teddy Riley guy bracelet
 So now it's fly shit I'm draped in, customized shit I'm makin'

 Digger gold, dig a bigger hole in ya soul

<|endoftext|>
Negotiating, my name holds weight, we motivatin'
 Hustling, as if God was dancing with Satan

<|endoftext|>
Gotta fight my case from the inside
 Niggas telling, I felt it coming when my pockets started swelling

<|endoftext|>
I was ill until they sunk me
 Killed the snitch with the pump 3 shots

<|endoftext|>
I twist 'em, baby mama beef victim
 Chronic leaf hitting, all kinds of heat with him, wisdom

<|endoftext|>
'Til it rains and my Timbs stain my socks
 'Til I dodge enough shots and the presiding judge slams a mallet

<|endoftext|>
Suggesting I post a, bail, I'm like, "Yes" 'cause we soldiers
 We just getting older, in time, we still in our prime

<|endoftext|>
Pennies on a pension or penitentiary bounded
 Plenty Henny in me, envy was simply they trend, see

<|endoftext|>
My enemy was every hater that was bigger than me
 The high life, the fly life

<|endoftext|>
Cold egg whites sat on my plate like
 3 AM, this is a spot frequented by some made men

<|endoftext|>
And all is real so all's worth mentioning Ice on gold from mossbergs to golf clubs
 Ninth hole, the white rose, the life I chose

 Many slain empty skulls where a brain should be

<|endoftext|>
They pass away, they went off the casket way
 My gats will spray, but that won't bring 'em back today

<|endoftext|>
Can't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind
 I ride past the church where they got his body and find

<|endoftext|>
They takin' him to the hearse to put his body in dirt
 That's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt

<|endoftext|>
Saw the enemy, I ate him, saw Jakes behind me
 They ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watchin' me Jealousy in the hood, felonies in the hood

<|endoftext|>
Still we behind the wheel with heat on us, hangin' with predicates
 Position we placed in caves in, so they got us caged in

<|endoftext|>
Waves spinnin' like Mike Bivens from New Edition agin'
 (I gotta... when the block is hot)

<|endoftext|>
I got families I'm feedin', 'cause my mans is bleedin'
 Every five seconds look in all directions

Then one-time intervene (I gotta hold...)
 My man ain't like me sayin' I don't care if I die

<|endoftext|>
Now, I'm the average nigga in the street life, God

<|endoftext|>
Cruisin' in his Chrysler, pursuin' niggas in my cipher
 Start wildin' like insane asylum on Rikers Island

<|endoftext|>
I play the side 'cause the words of man kill
 Proverbs buck out my grill, real as Ill Will, peep the steel!

<|endoftext|>
Nobody move, nobody die, why must I be high?
 Bustin' in trife bitches, touchin' mic switches

<|endoftext|>
Plant my seeds to live infinite, indeed in my sentences
 I flow demandin', that's understanding 850 tempo, but rugged like a Pinto

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
I'm sober in a stolen Range Rover, much crime

They wildin' with some freaks from the islands
 Piled in behind him, limosine, Benz

<|endoftext|>
He shouted, "Nas, roll with us"
 I'm bored so I followed him

<|endoftext|>
Like the hoes when they lay with me?
 Puppy eyes when I go, sayin’ “stay with me”

She's intuitive, be on some stupid shit
 She called the cops cause she hated his mother

<|endoftext|>
Now, how good could a black man have it?
 Livin' like a king is a habit, I keep a automatic

<|endoftext|>
Nicknamed the "Killa Clan", soon to kill a man
 If there's still a gram, I shake my left hand

<|endoftext|>
But on my head was a price

All of a sudden, I got raided, my crib was invaded
 But the Nas still made it...

New music, new content, new programming, I ran the gamut
 Got my hands in everything like kids with bad manners

<|endoftext|>
I don't practice, I don't remember my lines
 I'm just here so I don't get fined

<|endoftext|>
I was raised in it, early age
 Was presented with the ultimatum

We still livin', but our lives need much improvin'
 I think I'm gonna lose 'em Feelin' like I got the dons clout
