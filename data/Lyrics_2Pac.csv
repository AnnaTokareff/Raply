2Pac,Bomb First (My Second Reply),1996,"Bomb First (My Second Reply) Lyrics[Intro: Press Release]|In today's music news: the ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur has just released another album under the alias ""Makaveli."" Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail inter-chart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's – excuse me – Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from ""Hawaiian Sophie"" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac – rather Makaveli – was not available for comment but released this statement:||[Spoken: 2Pac]|It's not about East or West|It's about niggas and bitches|Power and money, ridaz and punks|Which side are you on?|*Heartbeat* *Gunshots*|*Encroaching footsteps*|These niggas is still fuckin' talkin'?|You niggas still breathin'?

It's a shame because the man's slain|He got caught in the chains of his own game|How can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me?|Sweated me, hunted me, trapped in my own community|One day I'm gonna bust, blow up on this society|Why did you lie to me? I couldn't find a trace of equality|Worked me like a slave while they laid back|Homie don't play that, it's time I let 'em suffer the payback|I'm tryin' to avoid physical contact|I can't hold back, it's time to attack, Jack|You might also like[Chorus: 2Pac & Shock G]|They got me trapped|Uh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down|You know they got me trapped|Nah, they can't keep the Black man down|Trapped|Uh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down|They got me trapped|Nah, they can't keep the Black man down||[Verse 3: 2Pac]|Now I'm trapped and walkin' for my getaway|All I need is a G and somewhere safe to stay|Can't use the phone 'cause I'm sure someone's tapping in|Did it before, ain't scared to use my gat again|I look back in hindsight, the fight was irrelevant|But now he's the Devil's friend, too late to be tellin' him|He shot first and I'll be damned if I run away|Homie is done away, I should've put my gun away|I wasn't thinkin', all I heard was the ridicule|Girlies was laughin', Tup saying, ""Damn, homie's dissin' you""|Fired my weapon, started steppin' in the hurricane|I got shot, so I dropped feelin' a burst of pain|Got to my feet, couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood|Now I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer|Ran through an alley, still lookin' for my getaway|Copper say, ""Freeze, or you'll be dead today""|Trapped in a corner, dark and I couldn't see the light|Thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life|What do I do? Live my life in a prison cell?|I'd rather die than be trapped in a living Hell|[Chorus: 2Pac & Shock G]|They got me trapped|Uh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down|They got me trapped|Nah, they can't keep the Black man down|Trapped|Uh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down|You know they got me trapped|Nah, they can't keep the Black man down||[Outro]|Trapped|Yo, y'all seen 2Pac, man?

That's what I am|America's nightmare|I am what you made me|The hate and the evil that you gave me|I shine as a reminder of what you've done to my people for four hundred plus years|You should be scared, you should be running|You should be trying to silence me|Ha, but you can not escape fate|For it is my turn to come|Just as you rose, you will fall|By my hands|America, you reap what you sow|2Pacalypse, America's nightmare|Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob, America's nightmare|Above The Law, America's nightmare|Paris, America's nightmare|Public Enemy, America's nightmare|KRS-One, America's nightmare|New Afrikan Panthers, America's nightmare|Mutulu Shakur, America's nightmare|Geronimo Pratt, America's nightmare|Assata Shakur, America's nightmare|Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera16Embed"

2Pac,Speech to Malcolm X Grassroots Movement,1992,"Speech to Malcolm X Grassroots Movement LyricsWatani Tyehimba: The first time I’m gonna talk about next|Is a person who is very near to me|A person who’s a second generation revolutionary|So please help me and welcome to you brother 2Pac Shakur||2Pac: First I want to say, Peace to my mother. She’s not here, but I gotta give a peace out to her. Because I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for my mother.||I looked on the front of this thing, and it said, “Start from within to rebuild our original greatness,” right? OK, well, that’s what my mother did, know what I’m sayin’. And I’m listening about freedom fighters and strugglers, and you gotta understand that  when it was in to have a gun and be in the street, my mother gave that up to be in the house and wash the dishes and feed us and put the thoughts in our brains. Because we didn’t get any of that history from any of those soldiers that we lost--we got none of that. They all went to jail, if you can remember. They all went to penitentiaries. We didn’t see none of that knowledge. If it was not for my mother, who stayed home and didn’t go out and do all that, then I wouldn’t have had shit--excuse my language. But I wouldn’t have been nowhere.||So, what I want to do, hopefully, is, I want to be--I am--Tupac Shakur. I have to be a reminder that it ain’t time to cool out, banquets and all that--it’s still on. It’s on just like it was when you were young. And you want to say “fuck that” just like you said “fuck that” back then. So how come now that I’m 20 years old, ready to start some shit up, everybody’s telling me to calm down. You know, don’t curse, go to school, go to college...well, fuck that. We’ve had colleges for a while now, now i'm saying, and there’re still Brenda’s out there, and nigga’s is still trapped. And it gets me irked [laughs] because I understand that it’s not gonna stop. It’s not gonna stop until we stop it.|And it’s not just white men that’s doing this to Brenda, and it’s not just white men that’s keeping us trapped. It’s black, you know what I’m sayin’? We have to find the new African in everybody, in all of us. Because if we keep running around looking for black and who got the most colors on and who got the baddest dashiki on, we still gonna get--and excuse my language--fucked.||It irks me right now that my mother is going through, you know, she has to get clean.  This is somebody I watched travel the whole country, during the time when women were scared to speak up for the Black Panthers. She spoke at Harvard, Yale, everywhere, and now I see my mother as what’s really going on, and I don’t see no big parades around my mother now. And she done got dozens of fucking awards. And I don’t see nobody there. You understand what I’m saying? So about all this, I take that lightly. I take all this lightly.|What I want you to take seriously is what we have to do for the youth, because we coming up in a totally different world. This is not the same world that you had. This is not the 60s, this is not that. You grew up B.C.--before crack. That should say it all. We did not grow up with our parents. You had parents, that told you this and that and this is what went on back in the day. Now do you don’t have that. You have young kids, fourteen, coming home and their mama’s smoking out, or doing it to their best friend to get the product. You understand what I’m saying?|So that means, it’s not just about you taking care of your child; it’s about you taking care of these children. It hurts that--no, it bothers me, not hurts--that I have to sidestep my youth to stand up and do some shit that somebody else supposed to be doing. It’s too many men out here for me to be doing this. It ain’t my turn yet. I’m supposed to be following behind him, getting the knowledge. I don’t even have a chance to get the fucking knowledge. I can’t go to college; it’s too much problems out here. I don’t got the money, nobody do.||So what I’m saying is that it’s not as easy as we mapping it out to be, and we gotta stay real. We gotta stay real. Before we can be new Africans, we gotta be black first. We gotta get our brothers from the street like Harriet Tubman did. Why can’t we look at that and see exactly what she was doing. Like Malcolm did, the real Malcolm, before the Nation of Islam. You gotta remember: this was a pimp, a pusher and all that. We forgot about all that. In our striving to be enlightened, we forgot about all our brothers in the street, about all our dope dealers, our pushers and our pimps, and that’s who’s teaching the next generation. Because y’all not doing it! I’m sorry, but it’s the pimps and the pushers who’s teaching us. So if you’ve got a problem with how we was raised, it’s because they was the only ones who could do it. They the only ones who did it. While everybody else wanted to go to college, and, you know, “everything has changed,” they were the ones telling you, “The white man ain’t shit. Here you go, check this out, young blood: You take this product, you switch it, you make money, and that’s how you beat the white man. You get money, and you get the hell up outta here.” Nobody else did that. So I don’t want to hear shit about nobody telling me who I can’t love and respect until you start doing what they did.||To me, this is Mecca. This is the black family--I see it here. But what makes it that much sadder, what makes me wanna cry is that, soon as I leave here, so does Mecca. We going back to the real deal. Right out there, you gonna see them same sisters in Brenda, they right out there. And y’all gonna get in y’all’s cars and drive the fuck home. I apologize. I apologize, but check this out: you can’t be no more offended by my cursing than what’s really going on. That’s real. That’s real, y’all. Because we letting the media--and the white man--turn us off. You letting them say that the rappers ain’t real, and either gotta be the ‘intelligent person’ or you a ‘gutter person.’ We all the same. We all feel it like y’all feel it.  I just can’t hold a straight face when I see it.|This is proof that we can be together. The young black male is the future of us. And the young black sister is the future of us. It’s gonna be what you put into it. So if you don’t put shit into it, don’t get mad when we blow up.50Embed"

What makes my freedom less worth fighting for than Bosnians or whoever they want to fight for this year?|They should give money to the ghetto||I mean I think even gangs can be positive. It just has to be organized|It has to steer away from being self-destructive to being self-productive|I organized the OGs on the East and West Coasts in penitentiaries|To come up with codes of ethics for criminals|It's called the Code of Thug Life|It's a code, putting order to the violence on the streets|In Watts, Compton, Chicago, wherever|People all over the country say, ""We go by this code|""We're against attacks on people not involved with the street gang, the drug trade or the illegal business at all.""||""All that kidnapping and shooting drive-bys, we against that.""|Thug Life ain't just a bunch of niggas going crazy|We wanna patrol our streets.

2Pac,Tupac’s Letter to Sister Souljah,1995,"Tupac’s Letter to Sister Souljah LyricsSouljah|Everytime I read your letters it makes me smile, think, laugh, and marvel at how easy it is 4 us 2 relate to one another (and that's no hustle.) It is my wish that when this letter reaches you it finds you and your family in safety and serenity. Now, where do I start? I'm sitting here with a fat stack of letters and through them all I immediately recognize your handwriting and know that you finally written me back and as usual it was worth the wait. This letter is hard to write because I'm editing as I write. I'm preoccupied with having any of my statements misjudged as ""hustling""! :) First of all, let me answer your questions. #1. No, I don't mind long letters in fact I wish yours were longer and yes I would love to not only hear of your adventures but also share some of my own. Yes, I will write a book. Right now I'm writing 3 screenplays so upon my release I can recoup from my losses. Instead of complaining about bad movie roles or negative stereotypes I'm writing my own visions. As far as the book is concerned, I am working on doing an Autobiography but if it is at all possible I want us to do a book together. That would truly be the ""BOMB""! Let me just tell you ever since I've read your book it has been going from person to person like a bible. Everybody from male inmates to female inmates have been reading it. I get a sense of pride at being the person to turn them on to your literary talents. Plus, I use your book with the women in my life. I have asked two females to read it and we use each chapter as a door to our own lives. Like the chapter on Nikki is my favorite. I was trying over the past few months to this female in my life why it was so hard 4 me 2 trust her regardless of how sweet and innocent she portrayed herself to be and only after reading that chapter did she finally understand. This is some personal shit but I feel as though I can trust you so.... Okay there's that chapter where you were contemplating sharing this man with another woman. I'm in that position now. I love one woman (A) because she's dependable, loving, supportive, and she's young and open to me guiding her through this crazy life (Who am I 2 guide?) Anyway woman ""A"" is from the streets and that's all she knows but I can see and feel how much she loves me. Woman ""B"" on the other hand is famous, rich, and able to assist me financially, loving, and very sexual. She's known me since before I got into the business and she's been there from the jump. However, she's bisexual and so into her career that we don't have much time together. So I'm literally torn between an old friend who went from being of a platonic nature to a potential wife and a new friend who has been there through the whole gunshot/rape/near death experience. I have rejected them both but then reconsidered and got 'em both back. They know of the other and I have tried to make it work as a threesome. Not sexually but commitment wise. Had I not read your book I would have continued living and juggling with all of these other women but between them both I completely satisfied. I've always felt that when I love someone it is so intense that I drive them away but with ""A"" and ""B"" it evens everything out. I can satisfy both of them and not because I'm a ""Supermanlove"" but because I truly love them both and the intensity and passion I feel for them keeps me driven to please them. Can u feel me? It's hard to explain on paper maybe when you visit me I can elaborate which brings me to my next step. Yes I would love 4 u 2 come visit me there isn't a list but there are certain days and times for each inmate. I'll attempt to reach you by phone to make it happen. Now back to me controlling my sexual desires. Now be honest, as a woman, how could you love a man that couldn't satisfy you? Since men are born totally inept sexually we only learn how 2 please a woman from pleasing a woman. So as rotten as it seems practice makes perfect. Every woman I have been with has not only taken what I learned from the last woman but taught me and prepared me for the next and since I am not married and yet to find the perfect woman you described I am forever in search of her. I have been with many married women from wives of powerful drug lords to the wives of broke everyday Joes to the wives of quite a few very famous and rich singers/actors and seeing their wives hungry for someone else has shown me that only by being able to completely satisfy a woman in every way, shape, and form can I truly find a happy and trusting faithful relationship. Now to answer your other questions. My health is fine I truly feel blessed that other than mentally I have no scars or lasting problems from my ""ordeal"". I still have the complete use of every nerve, limb, and muscle and more surprisingly I can still make love and have babies after taking a shot to my scrotum! Talk about faith in God! :)! Mentally however the helpless feeling never leaves me. I can't sleep! I wake up sweaty and disorientated when I do doze off and I will never erase the faces of my attackers from my mind. 2 be honest the bullets didn't hurt much not at first but afterwards it was painful. I didn't feel the shots in my head, hand, scrotum but because of all the muscles involved the leg wound was a real bitch! I don't really have any gun phobias meaning if it happened again I would react the same way. The pain came as I lay in the hospital thinking about the fact that some ""Thug"" brothers shot me. Then to hear I was found guilty of something I had not done plus wondering if my family was safe SCARED ME! Even with 5 gunshot wounds my paranoid ass was still sleeping with a 12 gauge and a Glock. I never planned to turn myself in I planned on shooting it out but upon further reflection I realized I owed alot to my people. Although I would have been at peace, the misery of our folks would continue. Besides I'm a Soldier and Soldiers use strategy not emotion no matter how bad the odds!You might also likeEmbed"

Little growin' boy of mine|With a tortured soul, addicted to a life of crime|Had no time for the growin' stage|He learned his values on the streets at an early age|Watch for police, don't come home, why?|'Cause Mama's actin' crazy at the hospital|'Bout to have another baby|Like a rose from the concrete, growin' within|Blessed with twins how the hell can Mama raise three men?|So we began, closest family, such insanity|A happy home, from one act of inhumanity|Plus Mama said the seed was corrupted|Used to rub her belly, beggin' us to breathe and she'd loved us|Now, Mama, sits quiet, sippin' peppermint Schnapps|Turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops (hey)|How could Mama bring a thug like me in this world?|She ain't the cause of all the drama|Cause Mama's just a little girl|You might also like[Hook: 2Pac]|(Stupid motherfuckers don't know)|Mama's just a little girl|(How can she raise us?)||[Verse 3: 2Pac]|Now, will she remain in the same spot?|The gunshots rang, they came from the 'caine spot|Now, look here, I see her clutchin' her son in her arms, she's hurt|Her heart bleeds, now she watched her seed die in the dirt|Fulfilled prophecy|But who could stop the grief I walk around, tryin' to hold the world, up on top of me|I'd probably be an innocent man, still I'm the victim of a curse|What could be worse? Nothing but pain, since my birth|Only functions at the pen', 'cause everybody's in|Payin' back society, I'm guilty of a life of sin|I watch the drama occur, my eyes blur before I jetted|I wonder why we all have to die 'fore we get it|Though we shed tears, so many peers I've done buried|Worried and scared, knowin' I'ma see the cemetery|Must be prepared, in this cold world, no one cares|No! It ain't fair, but we all bear and do our share|In this land of the underhanded schemes and plans|Vivid dreams of a nigga havin' G's in hand|Mama told me not to be a punk|Fuck what you talkin' about, coward, what you niggas want?

See, that's what I want to do.|Sanyika: That's right.|Tupac: If these gang niggas ain't gon' get straight, then I wanna take 'em out the game.|Sanyika: That's real.|Tupac: 'Cause if they don't, it's making trouble on us, you kna'mean?|Sanyika: 'Cause if you ain't part of the solution, then you part of the problem.|Tupac: No doubt.|Sanyika:  Where you gon' be when you tryna whack us anyway?|Tupac: No doubt! [Pac laughs]|Sanyika: Man, so shit, business as usual.|Tupac: That's how I feel.|Sanyika: But just pull up force is good, man. You know I want all that, Pac, you know. Any time, anything I can do, brother, you know, that's what I'm about, man. I've always been less the talker, more the doer and, um, you know, I mean, that's just my style, man.|Tupac: Yeah, no doubt, you talked to Bone?|Sanyika: Yeah, in fact, me and Bone--|Tupac: He finna do something too.|Sanyika: Yeah, Bone is doing when they shoot the movie, Bone doing the documentary called ""The Making of the Monster"", right?|Tupac: Oh, yeah.|Sanyika: And he's also doing another documentary, man.|Tupac: About gangbanging.|Sanyika: Yeah, about street organizations that's all footages from the Panthers.|Tupac: Man!|Sanyika: And, um, you know shit is fat, man. How's moms doing?|Tupac: She's doing good. We had a big-ass show in Vegas|Sanyika: Did she?|Tupac: We had a big-ass show. Me and the Dogg 'cause I'm on Death Row now.|Sanyika: Yeah, next reservations.|Tupac: Thanks.|Sanyika: You happy over there?|Tupac: Yes, aight so far, let me tell you, hold on a second.|Sanyika: Aight.|...||Tupac: Hello?|Sanyika: Yeah.|Tupac: That was my lawyer and shit.|Sanyika: What's up with the case though?|Tupac: Shit, it's gone crazy. I just—damn, hold on one second, please.|Sanyika: Alright, alright.|....||Tupac: Hello, yup. You know I had the police case.|Sanyika: Yeah. I heard they wanted you to compensate them.|Tupac: They trying to sue me!|Sanyika: Word!|Tupac: These fools shot at me!|Sanyika: And you defended yourself.|Tupac: And they trying to sue me.|[2Pac laughing]. And white people is crazy, 'cause if it was anybody else, they get that nigga a ticket to their parade.|Sanyika: Straight up.|Tupac: Unarmed man, two motherfuckers. I was fucked up. So they suing me, I got this girl who lied about the rape shit.|Sanyika: You smoking weed right now?|Tupac: Huh?|Sanyika: You smoking weed right now.|Tupac: Nah, cigarette, I will be smoking some weed. My homeboy is in Colombia right now.|Sanyika: Yeah.|Tupac: But, um, the girl. See, the girl that did this rape shit? She hooked up with the niggas that shot me.|Sanyika: Oh, is that right?|Tupac: They all connected. It was a big plan, I just caught it like at the end. And that's why they shot me.|Sanyika: Man! Hey, man, you gotta stay up, man. When you step through that, that way you gotta be on point.|Tupac: I ain't goin' through there no more, if I do, I'm going with hundred motherfuckers.|Sanyika: And I'll be one of them.|Tupac: Yup, no doubt.|Sanyika: No dizoubt. We can't be having you not here, you know what I'm saying?|Tupac: I know, that's what they told me. But you know what, you know what it was? Here's my problem. Just like I'm telling you what she saying, I always, 'cause I'm— Where my mom raised me the way I'm moving in, they fucked my head up in a way. See, like you, you could be movement-oriented but you got the gangbang shit first in your mind.|Sanyika: Right, right|Tupac: My shit, the gangbang shit come second to me.|Sanyika: Right, right.|Tupac: And now I'm trying to make it come first 'cause that movement shit will fuck you up. Movement shit got me loving every brother.|Sanyika: Yeah!|Tupac: You know what I mean?|Sanyika: At that point you know I gotta get next to you [?]|Tupac: Right, to me I'm there for you, nigga need money and job, I'm wit' you. Niggas come to me with guns on, niggas hugging me with TECs on, you know what I mean?|Sanyika: It just though. You know what the thing is, man? We gotta be individuals too inside the movement and wherever we involved in right? We gotta be able to differentiate between cats that are firm and cats that's ain't firm, sometimes it take sometimes but test. We talk about friends that's mean, you know. I am who I am, I survived through what I survived through by being intelligent, by not allowing cats to outsmart me and putting me in precarious positions where I can get whacked, right?|Trying to choose my friends very very carefully and I over said there's layers and layers of friends, you see. Some I hold close to the body, man, like a vest and others hold at arm's distance, some just look at, some I don't even fuck with, but the circles is small but the ones that are in there I believe are trustworthy right. For instance, you and I. You and I have been probably through the same shit in our lives|Tupac: No doubt.||Sanyika: You know what I'm saying? and we're like 10 years apart, almost. So it's like almost a common destiny. What you grew up then is where I came around too. You see what I'm saying? The banging shit was first with me and then the movement. Wit' you the movement was first and then the banging was came second.||Tupac: Yes that's the ill shit.|Sanyika: I'm getting around to where you grew up at|Tupac: And I'm getting around the way you grew up at.|Sanyika:  You see so, so who else better, you see, who can get along like you and I?||Tupac: No doubt.||Sanyika: Watching else's back.|Tupac: No doubt||Sanyika: 'Cause you want it, I want it, but together you know I mean. Man you got the courage of the godfather|when the shit-- what happened when [?] wrote that piece [?] dealing with the pigs right? I was like, 'That was my boy, man.""||Tupac: No doubt! You see, that's another problem. I'm helping another nigga, nigga I don't even know, nigga in the middle of the streets. He run off and don't even help me.||Sanyika: Yeah, that fucked up, man!||Tupac: These niggas that shot me, like, wanna see that when a white trash put a gun on me I can prepared. You know what I mean? I can react. When a nigga pull a gun on me, I'm like ""froze up"" I'm like ""Oh shit, a nigga gon' kill me?""||Sanyika: You know what we should do, Pac? I'm telling you, me and you should sit down, right, and we should do a book on you, man.||Tupac: Yeah? How you gon' do that?|Sanyika: You know what I'm talking about? I'm talking about, a straight up autobiography or something like that based on your life like Malcolm X [?] out with Alex Haley. I'm telling you, man. 'Cause the shit that you been through and I been through, just like my book man, I had to document that shit||Tupac: Hey, your book is I swear on everything. homie. I'm not just saying this shit. Your shit is a classic, yo. When I was up in that jailhouse, nigga who hated West Side they don't like nothing, they loving you. I had those motherfuckers speechless, they was reading, niggas that can't read was reading your shit in one day, nobody can put that shit down.||Sanyika: But yours just as explosive and I'm telling you, brother, I guarantee you before even get through it as a book Hollywood will be on our jock.||Tupac: They already want me to be something, poppin' hoes in the back 'cause I can't get the right one, I asked like Maya Angelou to help me write autobiography, she was like, ""Okay"".||Sanyika: You know what you need? Somebody to write it from our level to kick the slang and the shit right. Maya Angelou might put some perfect English in that motherfucker.||Tupac: And then it ain't come out right.|Sanyika: You and I, we gon' kick the language we kick.|Tupac: Figures like I be your shit.|Sanyika: I'm telling you.|Tupac: But you know where you gotta pull me into?|Sanyika: What?|Tupac: Overstand.|Sanyika: I'm telling you.|Tupac: Pull me here into overstand man|Sanyika: Dig it, this is the thing.||Tupac: I'll do it one time and I ain't [?]||Sanyika: Okay, dig it. The word ""understand"" is to play on one's person, right for instance, understand, to stand under, to be below, to be demeaned. And, so, when you're under anything, it's hard for you to get a whole view of what's going on above ground. So, when you're under, you have a disadvantage. So, especially when you're standing on someone or under anything, you can't comprehend it, you can't feel it, you can't vibe wit' it. So I created the word ""over-stand"" to get up over that shit, to get a vantage point, even looking down on some shit. You see what I'm sayin'? Like, a helicopter got a vantage point over us when we have to get in the streets and break. They can see us better than a pig at our level.||Tupac: So like that!||Sanyika: The helicopter has an overstanding on us to a great degree, you see what I'm saying? We have to do—Words control people, man, I'm telling you. When you think—when you speak positive, you think positive. So, all the time, I be trying to overstand shit, get a full comprehension.||Tupac: That's right!||Sanyika: You feel me? Yeah, that's where I came from, that concept came.||Tupac: That's right. Had you on that shit, man.||Sanyika: They made me like pops, they made me like pops.||[Tupac's laughs]||Sanyika: I'm telling you, me and pops was like, 'cause when I had Mutulu million, right? We were getting our court spot on, and he sending me the thugs' code. Of course I endorsed it, right? Then, next thing I know, I got a clipping [prisoners of war] so we had to do whole another trip with the mayor, alright. And then I heard [?] has drowned.||Tupac: Yeah, he aight now.||Sanyika: [?] He's respiratory.||Tupac: I'm in jail too. They telling me that shit. But shit that's fucked up was like me and him used to talk all the time. When I first came to L.A., he was like my eyes and ears. I told him everything. [?] that they he was, like, we was talking every day and they just killed that shit. I haven't talked to him in, like, a year. More than that.||Sanyika: But still they know you got legacy movement problems with the pigs. They stand to see you brother 'cause end up in the bloodline.||Tupac: You ain't lying. [?] calling me. Hold up one more time.|...||Tupac: Hello?||Sanyika: Yeah.||Tupac: But, man [?] shit that I couldn't even read your shit like how you been saying when hit the nigga in nuts and all that shit||Sanyika: Yeah.||Tupac: you ain't lying, I get up these motherfuckers calling me nigger, and I'm buggin out, I never had white people calling me nigger and nothing happened. And [?] you get 7 years if you touched the police no matter what, 7 years no matter what, 'cause I was in maximum security in Dannemora then they had me in a special program like a federal program they got called APPU - Advance Placement something something something - where all like notorious motherfuckers. I'm hopping in there niggas with 80­. Damn, one more time...||Sanyika: Alright.||Tupac: Hello. I'm up in there with niggas with 80 years and 60 years and I'm doing one and a half to four and a half. And I'm knowing my life in danger. These niggas ain't never getting out.||Sanyika: Yeah. I've seen moms on [?] she was [?] that, right? That she had you in a maximum security prison.||Tupac: Yup! Locked down 23 hours a day.||Sanyika: That's how you had me.||Tupac: Before I even broke the rules.||Sanyika: And that's heavy. And you didn't even get an opportunity to break one.||Tupac: And he was like for my own protection 'cause I wouldn't find it [?] but they got mad right, cause they was telling me that you goin to die in here and you gon die in here, I said why am just have to die here, I'm not starting no PC. He like they put you in IPC-- that's Involuntary Protective Custody.||Sanyika: Right, right||Tupac: So, I'm fighting, I'm getting lawyers to fight me to get out of there to get me in population 'cause they put me in population the first day I got there, right?||Sanyika: Was it true?||Tupac: Hell yeah! Even though I'm on the other side, I'm with all enemies. These niggas hating 'cause I'm banging on East Coast, screaming, ""West side, west side"" any team everything. So, when I get there,|the pigs, they ain't get me no toilet sheets. You know, you come there you get that cock shit, it was bloody cot, no nothing.|He left me in population for, like, two hours. In two hours, I had everything I needed. Niggas gave me two stakes, two|niggas bringing knives, weed, heroin, cocaine everything I wanted. I was like ""Nah, I'm cool, homie I don't need that."" I gave the niggas their bangers back, I didn't want no bangers. They want to stab me up for nothing. It was three murders while I was there.||Sanyika: Damn [?]||Tupac: They got the highest level of murders in New York State. You can get murdered, man, niggas with the same pow line know what's happen.||Sanyika: Dannemora, huh?|Tupac: Yep, they crazy up there.|Sanyika: It was proper.|Tupac: They crazy up there, riot.|Sanyika: They been hooking you up on the video.|Tupac: Yeah, no doubt. I wanted to keep my face out there.|Sanyika: You shot that shit.||Tupac: We finna gon' shoot another video. Me and Dre finna do the shit called ""California Love"" with Roger.||Sanyika: Oh, okay.|Tupac: it's gon' be the bomb, mayne, peep it up for California, mayne.|Sanyika: I be glad to see you back out there.||Tupac: I got to take it all back. I won't be happy 'til I do it. They gotta be sorry for what they did.||Sanyika: I'm telling you, hey, I'm wit' you, man.||Tupac: Got to.||Sanyika: Check this out. I wanna come down and chill wit' you.||Tupac: Come on, man, what's up? I be having Operations From the Bottom.||Sanyika: Yup||Tupac: They be in there with me kicking it.||Sanyika: Yeah, I like them. I give shout-out for them. But I'm telling you, some lyrics man—||Tupac: Come on, you come with some lyrics, you can spit on any song I got.||Sanyika: I got some shit, I'm telling you.||Tupac: I'm in the studio today. I'm in the studio every day.|Sanyika: Okay, what about Friday?|Tupac: Friday? I be there, that's when Sista Soulja coming through.|Sanyika: Okay, I'ma call you.

2Pac,1995 Police Station Testimony,1995,"1995 Police Station Testimony LyricsWoman – Sir, will you raise your right hand, please? Do you swear and confirm that the testimony that you are about to give is the truth, nothing but the truth, the whole truth?||Tupac – I do||Police – Could you please state your full name for the record?||Tupac – Yes, Tupac Amaru Shakur||Police – What is your age and resident address?||Tupac – I just turned 24 on the 16th of June. I live in Decatur, Georgia|Police – How did you get interested in music?||Tupac – I started off with poetry, with writing poetry||Police – Junior High, High School?||Tupac – Yes, Junior High, High School||Tupac – And poets I saw when I looked on the Webs*, I did that personally, but then I started turning poetry into songs and I got more attention||Police – How did you get into rap?||Tupac – It’s of my opinion that I was rapping while I was writing poetry..||Police – Okay||Tupac – and so I was into rap, I guess you could say from Junior High, when I wrote my first poems. And after I heard on the radio that there were other poets, who were making records and they were selling and it was working, that’s when I decided to change the method of my poetry||Police – How do you define rap? What constitutes rap?||Tupac – That’s what it is to me: poetry. To me it’s story-telling poetry||Police – To music, music with a beat?||Tupac – With or without music you cannot define rap|You might also likePolice – But it goes, it has sometimes a beat, a tune to it, doesn’t it, even if it hasn’t got accompaniment to it?||Tupac – No, even a pentameter is rap. It’s how you write it, the structure, it depends how you write it, and as to whether it has a beat, I guess it won’t sell as much if you don’t have a beat; the beat is more of a selling tool||Police – Now, you were performing by the time you did your solo-album what people call “gangsta rap”.,||Tupac – No||Police – You were not?||Tupac – No!||Police – What would you call what you were performing?||Tupac – Rap music!||Police – Have you ever performed gangsta rap?||Tupac – No!||Police – Okay, and why would you say that?||Tupac – Because, Number One, I do not know what “gangsta rap”, is, number two, I would not classify what my music is as gangsta rap||Police – Have you heard the term?|Tupac – A lot!||Police – Okay||Police – The next statement is a “Victim for Real” : “I really got my ass beat, I really don’t like police”||Tupac – I didn’t say that. Where were you at right there? Oh, there. I didn’t say that: that’s not what it says…It says: “I’m a victim for real, everything I talk is for real, I really got my ass beat, I really don’t like …” The interviewer wrote POLICE||Police – Did you mean ””?||Tupac – No||Police – What did you mean?||Tupac – I really don’t like “crooked police”||Police – Okay. So you feel okay about other police?||Tupac – Feel okay?||Police – You like other police?||Tupac – I like everybody that just does their job; I mean it depends on, I don’t know…. Personally, if I meet someone that is kind-hearted*, that’s true and that’s fair, then I like them, especially in a position like that, when a person has to put their life on line*, and they can still be fair to everybody they meet, I definitely like them, and I admire that..||Police – Are you aware of any others who had shot a policeman, especially teenagers who shot policemen after listening..||Lawyer – “after ALLEGEDLY listening”||Police – That’s right, “after allegedly listening”: they said they were listening to your music||Tupac – NO||Police – and that’s what caused them to do it..||Tupac – But none of them said this until you guys started saying this, they put it all over the news and had Danny Quayle* say it..||Police – I’m asking you, are you aware of any others?||Tupac – No, NO!||Police – When did you first start getting fan-mail? Remember what year?||Tupac – No, I don’t||Police – I hear you said you also received unfavourable mail?||Tupac – Yeah, like this! I got a lot of mail from you’all..||Police – From fans?||Tupac – No! From “you’all”: YOU guys, the lawyers… lawsuits*||Police – What else, did you receive unfavourable mail?||Tupac – In my whole career I believe I got 5 pieces of hate mail.

(Dear Mama)|Sweet lady, place no one above ya|(Just so you know, you are appreciated)|Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?||[Verse 3: 2Pac]|Pour out some liquor and I reminisce|‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama|And when it seems that I'm hopeless|You say the words that can get me back in focus|When I was sick as a little kid|To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did|And all my childhood memories|Are full of all the sweet things you did for me|And even though I act crazy|I gotta thank the Lord that you made me|There are no words that can express how I feel|You never kept a secret, always stayed real|And I appreciate how you raised me|And all the extra love that you gave me|I wish I could take the pain away|If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day|Everything will be alright if you hold on|It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on|And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan|Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated|[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin + (2Pac)]|Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)|Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)|Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

It'd be the first time I lost|But if I beat 'em, it'd finally prove that I'm the boss|I grabbed my leather jacket, walked through the streets|Suckas was hopin' and prayin', Strictly D.O.P.E. would get beat|I begin to get hype, I was ready to fight|Yo, I was confident that I'd win, to hell with the mic!|I hop on to the stage, Dize started the beat|The sucka' shivered, because he tasted defeat|Then I signaled to Dize and bust a rhyme off my head|Perpetrator fell back (Ha!) And then he was dead|I was happy as hell, 'cause I was lucky that night|Put my hand in my pocket, and there was my mic|Haha|[Chorus]|Now why you tell em that?|The case of the misplaced mic||[Verse 2: 2Pac & Roc-T]|I'm down with Strictly D.O.P.E.

2Pac,The Rape Case,,"The Rape Case LyricsPac's story||Okay. Nigel and Trevor took me to Nell's. When we got there, I was immediately impressed, because it was different than any club I'd been in. It wasn't crowded, there was lots of space, there were beautiful women there. I was meeting Ronnie Lott from the New York Jets and Derrick Coleman from the Nets. They were coming up to me, like, ""Pac, we're proud of you."" I felt so tall that night, because they were people's heroes and they saying I was their hero. I felt above and beyond, like I was glowing.||Somebody introduced me to this girl. And the only thing I noticed about her: She had a big chest. But she was not attractive; she looked dumpy, like. Money came to me and said, ""This girl wants to do more than meet you."" I already knew what that meant: She wanted to fuck. I just left them and went to the dance floor by myself. They were playing some Jamaican music, and I'm just grooving.||Then this girl came out and started dancing-and the shit that was weird, she didn't even come to me face-first, she came ass-first. So I'm dancing to this reggae music; you know how sensuous that is. She's touching my dick, she's touching my balls, she opened my zipper, she put her hands on me. There's a little dark part in Nell's, and I see people over there making out already, so she starts pushing me this way. I know what time it is.||We go over in the corner. She's touching me. I lift up my shirt while I'm dancing, showing off my tattoos and everything. She starts kissing my stomach, kissing my chest, licking me and shit. She's going down, and I'm, like, Oh shit. She pulled my dick out; she started sucking my dick on the dance floor. That shit turned me on. I wasn't thinking, like, This is going to be a rape case. I'm thinking, like, This is going to be a good night. You know what I'm saying?||Soon as she finished that-just enough to get me solid, rock-hard-we got off the dance floor. I told Nigel, ""I've got to get out of here. I'm about to take her to the hotel. I'll see you all later."" Nigel was, like, ""No, no, no. I'm going to take you back."" We drive to the hotel. We go upstairs and have sex, real quick. As soon as I came, that was it. I was tired, I was drunk, I knew I had to get up early in the morning, so I was, like, ""What are you going to do? You can spend the night or you can leave."" She left me her number, and everything was cool. Nigel was spending the night in my room all these nights. When he found out she sucked my dick on the floor and we had sex, he and Trevor were livid! Trevor is a big freak; he was going crazy. All he kept asking me was, ""D-d-did you fuck in the ass?"" He was listening to every single detail. I thought, This is just some guy shit, it's all good.|We had a show to do in New Jersey at Club 88. This dude said, ""I'll be there with a limo to pick you up at midnight."" We went shopping, we got dressed up, we were all ready. Nigel was saying, ""Why don't you give her a call?"" So we were all sitting in the hotel, drinking. I'm waiting for the show, and Nigel's, like, ""I called her. I mean, she called me, and she's on her way."" But I wasn't thinking about her no second time. We were watching TV when the phone rings, and she's downstairs. Nigel gave Man-man, my manager, some money to pay for the cab, and I was, like, ""Let that b*tch pay for her own cab."" She came upstairs looking all nice, dressed all provocative and shit, like she was ready for a prom date.||So we're all sitting there talking, and she's making me uncomfortable, because instead of sitting with Nigel and them, she's sitting on the arm of my chair. And Nigel and Trevor are looking at her like a chicken, like she's, like, food. It's a real uncomfortable situation. So I'm thinking, Okay, I'm going to take her to the room and get a massage. I'm thinking about being with her that night at Nell's. So we get in the room, I'm laying on my stomach, she's massaging my back. I turn around. She starts massaging my front. This lasted for about a half an hour. In between, we would stop and kiss each other. I'm thinking she's about to give me another blow job. But before she could do that, some niggas came in, and I froze up more than she froze up. If she would have said anything, I would have said, ""Hold on, let me finish."" But I can't say nothing, because she's not saying nothing. How do I look saying, ""Hold on""? That would be like I'm making her my girl.||So they came and they started touching her a**. They going, ""Oooh, she's got a nice ass."" Nigel isn't touching her, but I can hear his voice leading it, like, ""Put her panties down, put her pantyhose down."" I just got up and walked out the room.||When I went to the other suite, Man-man told me that Talibah, my publicist at the time, had been there for a while and was waiting in the bedroom of that suite. I went to see Talibah and we talked about what she had been doing during the day, then I went and laid down on the couch and went to sleep. When I woke up, Nigel was standing over me going, ""Pac, Pac,"" and all the lights was on in both rooms. The whole mood had changed, you know what I'm saying? I felt like I was drugged. I didn't know how much time had passed. So when I woke up, it was, like, ""You're going to the police, you're going to the police."" Nigel walks out the room, comes back with the girl. Her clothes is on; ain't nothing tore. She just upset, crying hysterically. ""Why you let them do this to me?"" She's not making sense. ""I came to see you. You let them do this to me."" I'm, like, ""I don't got time for this shit right here. You got to chill out with that shit. Stop yelling at me and looking at me all crazy."" She said, ""This not the last time you're going to hear from me,"" and slammed the door. And Nigel goes, ""Don't worry about it, Pac, don't worry. I'll handle it. She just tripping."" I asked him what happened, and he was, like, ""Too many niggas."" You know, I ain't even tripping no more, you know? niggas start going downstairs, but nobody was coming back upstairs. I'm sitting upstairs smoking weed, like, Where the fuck is everybody at? Then I get a call from Talibah from the lobby saying, ""The police is down here.""|||Never did nothing. Only thing I saw was all three of them in there and that nigga talking about how fat her ass was. I got up, because the nigga sounded sick.

2Pac,The Last Days (Davey D),1998,"The Last Days (Davey D) LyricsDavey D: On November 30th, 1994, while waiting in the lobby of a Times Square studio, Tupac became the victim of an attempted robbery. He resisted and was shot five times. Left for dead, Tupac shocked the world by not only surviving, but checking out the hospital just days after the incident. Tupac was in New York filming a video as well as awaiting the fate of his trial for the sexual assault charges he was indicted for the year before. He would eventually be sentenced to four and a half years in prison. He would also accuse former rap partner Notorious B.I.G. as the person who set him up to be shot. It was these accusations that intensified the supposed East/West Coast rivalry within hip hop. Now just before Tupac began serving his sentence for sexual assault charges, he released his third album entitled Me Against The World. It was on this album the world heard Tupac's tribute to his mom entitled ""Dear Mama."" After serving a little more than seven months in New York's correctional facilities, Tupac was released on 1.3 million dollars bail and signed to Death Row Records, the home to Snoop Dogg and Tha Dogg Pound. He quickly made noise with the release of his hit song ""California Love,"" a track featuring himself and Dr. Dre. While awaiting his appeal, Tupac released the double album All Eyez On Me. It featured all sorts of artists, ranging from R&B crooner Jodeci to Baby Area locals like Dru Down and Richie Rich. Ironically while out on bail, Tupac had managed to again embroil himself in controversy. He was arrested twice for parole violations and accused of causing a disturbance that took place at the Soul Train Music Awards. Reports confirmed that he confronted Notorious B.I.G. backstage. On September 7th, 1996, 2Pac and CEO of Death Row Suge Knight left the Mike Tyson-Bruce Seldon fight in Las Vegas in Suge's car. A white Cadillac with four people inside pulled alongside at an intersection, and on person stepped out and opened fire. Tupac was hit four times while Suge escaped with minor injuries. Tupac was brought to the University Medical Center. On Friday, September 13, 1996, Tupac died after six days in critical condition. Tupac Shakur was pronounced dead at 4:03 PM. His body was later cremated. He was only 25.||(He was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25...)||[Piano Instrumental]Embed"

2Pac,Evolution Of A Thug (Davey D),1998,"Evolution Of A Thug (Davey D) LyricsDavey D: His mother, Afeni Shakur, was a member of the Black Panther Party.  She was pregnant with Tupac while in jail and on trial as one of the Infamous New York 21. This was a time where all the members of the party were accused of conspiracy to bomb public places. Afeni Shakur was eventually acquitted of all charges. Tupac's aunt Assata Shakur was also a member of the Black Panther Party. She was accused of killing a New Jersey state trooper. She eventually fled the country in exile. Today she still lives in Cuba. Tupac described his mom as a strong-willed woman who handled her business. His real father was unknown. As a youth, he identified with a pimp and petty hustler named ""Legs"" who later died from a crack-induced heart attack. Tupac was described as an energetic child who always liked to imagine himself in the lead role. His mom saw fit to enroll him at age 12 in the 127 Street Ensemble, which was a theatre group in Harlem, New York. Tupac’s first acting role was the character, Travis, in the play Raisin in the Sun. Tupac did not involve himself with rap until he and his family moved to Baltimore. As a young teenager, he took on the name ""MC New York."" While living in Baltimore, Tupac continued his acting by auditioning and later being accepted in Baltimore's Prestigious School for the Arts. At age 17, Tupac moved with his mom to Marin City in the San Francisco Bay area. It was in Marin City that Tupac lived about street life. In an attempt to be accepted and fit in with his peers, Tupac became a petty hustler who sold drugs. It was in Marin City that Tupac rediscovered rap. He ingratiated himself in the Bay Area's emerging rap scene by joining a group called Strictly Dope. This group featured fellow Bay Area rap star Ray Luv. While a member of Strictly Dope, Tupac decided to branch out and he eventually became friends with Digital Underground’s lead rapper, Shock G. Tupac auditioned for the group and he eventually became part of the group first as a roadie and later as a dancer. He went on to be a hype man for the group Digital Underground. As a member of Digital Underground, Tupac became known as ""the rebel of the underground."" Much of this had to do with his excitable and unpredictable personality. Tupac's tendency to stir up things had lead to many of his successes, as well as many of his troubles.||(Troubles, troubles, troubles, troubles...)Embed"

2Pac,Trouble Followed (Davey D),1998,"Trouble Followed (Davey D) LyricsDavey D: In 1991, Tupac got his first real taste of trouble when he was stopped for jay walking in downtown Oakland. According to Pac, the police officers did not take a liking to his name, for they said some unfavorable things. Pac in return responded and the result was him being arrested and brutalized. This incident resulted  in him filing a 10 million dollar lawsuit against the City of Oakland. It wasn't long afterwards that Tupac released the first of his six albums. The first was entitled 2Pocalypse Now and it highlighted Tupac’s passionate, political, and thug life side. Songs like ""Trap"" while politically on point, stirred up much of the controversy when it depicted an Oakland police officer being shot at the end of the video. This particular song caught the attention of Dan Quayle, who expressed his outrage. Other songs like ""Brenda Got a Bay"" brought attention to the emotional and heartfelt side of the rising star. Tupac gained national fame when he played the role of Roland Bishop, a violent, insecure, short-tempered, psychotic individual, and the blockbuster movie Juice. Initially, director Ernest Dickerson had invited Digitial Underground's Money B to audition for the movie. Tupac went along for the ride. Once there, he read the part cold turkey and was hired to play his role, which left many wondering if Tupac was acting or just being himself. As Tupac's popularity began to soar, so did his troubles. In the Summer of ’92 while attending Marine City's 50th Anniversary, Tupac and his entourage had a confrontation with some old acquaintances. During the ensuing fight, a gun was drawn, shots were fired, and a little six-year-old laid dead as an innocent bystander. Tupac's brother Mercedes, who at the time rapped for the group Tony! Toni! Toné! and later for Thug Life, was arrested and charged. Eventually he was let go for lack of evidence. Tupac later found himself embroiled in more controversy when a Texas cop was shot and killed. The widow of the slain officer filed the multi-million dollar civil suit against Tupac, claiming that it was his music and lyrics that influenced the young perpetrator to kill. If that wasn't enough, also in that year, Tupac while visiting the set of Fox TV's In Living Color had an altercation with the limo driver. The result was him being arrested and charged with assault. Eventually the charges would drop. Seemingly wherever Tupac went, trouble followed. First Tupac found himself being charged with assault after he and a group of friends beat up the film directors known as the Hughes Brothers. This incident stemmed from him being fired from the movie Menace II Society.||(-Ciety, -ciety, -ciety, -ciety)Embed"

2Pac,Mad Trouble (Davey D),1998,"Mad Trouble (Davey D) LyricsDavey D: Later that year in October of '93, Tupac was arrested and accused of shooting two off-duty police officers in Atlanta. Just as that drama was beginning to be sorted out, he was arrested in New York the following month and accused of sexually assaulting a female fan in his hotel room. In the backdrop of that controversy, Tupac managed to release another album entitled Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z., which featured the smash hits ""I Get Around"" and it's emotional tribute to women, ""Keep Your Head Up."" During this time, Tupac was featured in two more movies. The first was Poetic Justice with Janet Jackson. Here he stirred things up again on the set by refusing to honor Miss Jackson's request to take an AIDS test. The other movie that featured Tupac came out in the Spring of '94 with a basketball movie entitled Above The Rim. Just like he did in the movie Juice, here Tupac adorned the role of a gangster.||(Gangster, gangster, gangster, gangster, gangster...)Embed"

And y'all need to protect me and you need protect your damn self. We can't do nothing but speeches, books [?], putative none of that shit. You need a mothafuckin' Mini-14 or M16 something. You need to call [?] before some of these mothafuckas crack us. 'Cause we dying, we dying, we can't be kings and queens 'til we still livin', do you feel me?— [Applause]||I moved to Los Angeles, you know? And the reason I moved to Los Angeles 'cause I wanna be where the niggas is kicking up dust at, you know?

So when you see me in [?], you going, going, ""Damn what's wrong with him"", you know, ayy it's hard out there, it's hard out there to see a hardcore nigga by hisself. When I go home, I go home by my mothafuckin' self. when I close the door, it's by my mothafuckin' self, you feel me?||It's time for some soldier shit, you know from the females, and from the males, that's real. And it's time for the women, I'm not blaming it on you, I'm not putting it in your corners, but you have so much you don't know, you have so much power over us look— [Applause] You run shit, but you just don't know. And it's a game I know I'm man I'll peep y'all to the game. When a nigga see truth to any name for him, he's gon' run ya. But if you keep your principles, if you stay in your ground, you know what you want, you know what you want out that nigger. You push that or leave that, trust me it ain't no shortage in young black males— [Applause]||Represent, you know.|That's how we gotta handle that, you know we gotta handle that shit. We got be poor like down for each other, you know, I know we not supposed to use the town in term gangster, bitch, but damn we got to be down for each other, you know, we got to be soldiers, man they gon' be writing about us in twenty years, you know. It's— it's that time y'all, it's that time. It's the 90s, do you know what 90s is upside down? two fuckin' 60s, you know what I'm sayin'? We gon' turn this shit upside down all over again. And we don't want they got the power to do it. Did you see what happened in April 29ths? Y'all ain't see that shit on the news? To see that five minute [?] it's fuckin' shit up in LA. I was there, I was filming a movie getting paid g's, but that night I was there. I was in streets with my folks, niggas hadn't. I don't care what they said about gangbangings in LA (That's violence). Niggas had big mothafuckin dawgs up, and it was all good. Whatever they say— I'm I'm telling y'all man. This the style I'm keeping in my [mind]. This picture I'm keeping in my mind 'til it happen again. 'Cause I seen it for myself, and I know it can happen. In all my life I never thought it can happen. But I've seen it for myself, I was there, and you know what made it happen ""War"" a common enemy, we was fighting a common enemy. So it was like ""What's up"". And that's what we need now! 'Cause all the dudes has been here study [?], we studying the fight, maaan!— [Crowds laughs]||Come on! We are studying the fight, getting ready to fight. And we doing all of our fighting, not nothing is wrong with going to the cops. but I tell y'all I'm proud of these brothers. But we doing all of our fighting in debates, we debate and shit. We debate for our freedom. [Laughs] We ain't get it in no legislation. We ain't finna get it through marching. We ain't even finna get it through one rock, one up wiser, we not finna get through on April 29th. We finna get it everyday you've got all of us everywhere see that as a necessity that we struggle to fight back. We have that as a right, that is our right when we born, God put it to your heart to self-defend your mothafuckin' self (Yeah!) Fuck the next nigga, you know, if that nigga wanna be a gangbang, he don't wanna follow your way. Fuck that nigga, trust me. He's outta here, he's outta here. But you have you have obligations to your folks to niggas that thirty, forty to handle your mothafuckin' business, no matter what it is. If it's all they gonna be pretty— all they all be out there with Mini-14, some of that shit gon' be sustaining your ass home with the kids. Put some knowledge in your kid's head, you know what I'm saying? All the niggas and all the females. Just 'cause she a female don't mean she got to stay home with the beds, that's bullshit. 'Cause I would much rather have some of these females out there being at war with some of these niggas. It's a whole bunch of punks, you know? [?] the city and we African-Americans, everything is equal shit. And is talking NWACP shit I hope I speak on that too. 'Cause I was reading a paper I saw NWACP at a celebration for the emancipation proclamation (That's right)— [Crowd laughs] (Go ahead Pac).||Okay, So from what I just said how is the NWACP still in business? (Come on) Oh ain't nobody having it. How is the NWACP still in business? How these mothafuckas still in business, we— (White folks yo). ""White folks!"" that's cool too, that's cool too. We letting them do that shit, we letting them represent us. How a mothafucka go to stand there talking about he a putting advance in a colored folks. What the fuck is that?|And these be grown black folks, they be our color. Representing us these white folks, and we be letting them do, 'cause we broke, 'cause they got all the suits, they got officers and shit. And as they now making all NWACP and we let them do that shit representing us, you know? They make us look bad. Really? We are two umm— I'm not tryna take up for the thugs and the gangstas and shit, but now I'm coming from a different school, I'm coming from the panthers, and that's what they need. Yeah I done went to the street element, and that's what they mobilize their soldiers, you know that's what my mama did. That's my job. I'mma stay in the streets and get my thug niggas who was down for me in the streets. 'Cause I'mma tell when mama start cracking and I was by myself. This brother right here Watani Tyehimba was the only person in this movement, anywhere that took care of me. Okay! So there ain't no mothafuckin' struggle if you done take care of your babies. Not just yours, but the other soldiers, you know? What about them? What about all the soldiers sitting in jail, where they kids at? Don't none of y'all mothafuckas give a fuck about them? ready to carry a flag always son. You ain't taking care of your mothafuckin' kids or they families, that's hypocritical. That ain't right! That shit ain't right man, We got too many kids out here with no— nobody put none in their head, then you mothafuckas get mad when you see 'em again up in the courtroom, you know. Told 'em 'bout, ""Why you like that"" Nigga you left him by hisself. Left him by his mothafuckin' self. So he learn how to be a g from the crackers, and that's what he learned, he learned how they wanted him to be.||Nobody, nobody taught me shit, and my mama was a panther, you know, my mama would tell you, but she was too involved in it to sit down and really explain shit to me, you know. So it's a double tragedy, because I'm like damn-near enforced to go through some of the shit that some of these soldiers went through, but because they didn't tell the new generations they didn't harm us, I gotta go through the shit all over again, you know? I'm still getting my ass kicked by police, 'cause them niggas back in the 60s didn't murder every single one of them motherfuckers, you know. They wanna be down with the police department! How can I see? How the fuck can a nigga put on a police uniform in 1993? Fuck that!— [Applause]||Fuck that. When the shit jumps off, if you still got that mothafucka on you, your ass is out. And if you got on armed forces uniform, your ass is out. And if you end your gore, your ass is out. 'Cause niggas is harmed in 1993. The game element all armed. And they all met as much as you wanted to think they dumb or whatever. They on they toes, this mothafuckin' year. They on they toes, they ready to move, when are you ready? how you gon' handle it? Ha? When them niggas get out free with guns, what y'all gon' be doing? Watching that shit on TV? Marching? Singing? Selling raffle tickets and shit from the church. What y'all gon' be doing? I just wanna know, 'cause I know what the fuck I'mma be doing, but it would help me to know what my people is gon' be doing when I'm out there.||'Cause mama tell me all the time, ""Boy you think you gon' save the world, don't you know they gon' kill your black ass, these people gon' bubble you, and that's that"" So all I'm saying the closer is that we got to be united under whatever, whatever, don't let shit hold us apart. I don't care if you from Cali, New York or whatever you are a Blood, a Crip or a thug or a student or a scholar whatever. Don't let shit hold us back no more. We got to unite by any means|necessary and we got to fight!— [Applause]Embed"
2Pac,On My Block,2002,"On My Block LyricsThey got a nigga sheddin' tears, reminiscin' on my past fears|'Cause shit was hectic for me last year|It appears that I've been marked for death, my heartless breath|The underlyin' cause of my arrest, my life is stressed|And no rest forever weary, my eyes stay teary|For all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery|Shit is scary, how black on black crime legendary|But at times unnecessary, I'm gettin' worried|Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic|And certain death for us, ghetto bastards|What can we do when we're arrested, but open fire?|Life in the pen ain't for me, 'cause I'd rather die|But don't cry through your despair|I wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggas on welfare|And who cares if we survive|The only time they notice a nigga is when he's clutchin' on a four five|My neighborhood ain't the same|'Cause all these little babies goin' crazy|And they sufferin' in the game and I swear it's like a trap|But I ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when I go back|Hoes show me love, niggas give me props|Forever hope 'cause it don't stop on my block||Livin' life is but a dream|Hard times is all we see|On my block|Every block is kinda mean|But on our block we still play|But on our block we still play||Now shits constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots|Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops|Black male slippin' in hail, when will we prevail?|Fearin' jail but crack sales got me livin' well|And the system's suicidal with this thug's life|Stayin' strapped forever strapped in this drug life|God help me, 'cause I'm starvin' can't get a job|So I resort to violent robberies my life is hard|Can't sleep 'cause all the dirt make my heart hurt|You might also likePut in work and shed tears for my dead peers|Mislead from childhood where I went astray|Till this day I still pray for a better way|Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke|From the start I felt the racism 'cause I'm dark|Couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent|Hit the bar and played the star everywhere I went|In my heart, I felt alone out here on my own|I close my eyes and picture home on my block||Livin' life is but a dream|Hard times is all we see|On my block|Every block is kinda mean|But on our block we still play|But on our block we still play||And I can't help but wonder why, so many young kids had to die|Caught strays from A.K's in the drive by|Swollen pride and homicide don't coincide|Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside|'Cause our block is filled with danger|Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers|Time changes us to stone them crack pipes|All up and down the block exterminatin' black life|But I can't blame the dealers|My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels|Shits real, I know you feel, my tragedy|A single mother with a problem child, daddy free|Hangin' out pickin' up game, sippin' cheap liquor|Gamin' the hooches, hopin' I can get to sleep with her|It's a man's world, stayin' strapped|Fantasies of a nigga livin' phat, but held back|Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless|Wide eyed and losin' focus on my block||Livin' life is but a dream|Hard times is all we see|On my block|Every block is kinda mean|But on our block we still play|But on our block we still play||And block parties in tha projects lastin' way past daylight|A young nigga learned to break night|Used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen|I send 'em ends, but it's tough on a friend|In my mind I see the same motherfuckers ballin'|Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, miss his call|I know the young niggas understand this|Growin' up in this world where everythin' is scandalous|I reminisce on tha fast times, past crimes||Tryin' to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime|Can't explain just what attracts me to this dirty game|Gold chains some extra change, and the street fame|And what's strange is everybody knows my name|Swear they all know me|And lots of cash make a nigga change|I hit the green just to maintain, feelin' pain|For all the niggas that I lost to the game from my block|Thats right||Livin' life is but a dream|Hard times is all we see|Rest in peace to all the muh'fuckers who passed away|Every block is kinda mean|From all the blocks that I'm from|But on our block we still play||One twelve street, Seventh Avenue, New York, Uptown|Know what I'm sayin?|But on our block we still play|183rd and Walt, my block, that's right|But on our block we still play|122nd and Morningside, my block, that's right|But on our block we still play||Decatur Avenue, Baltimore, my block, that's right|But on our block we still play|In the jungle of Atlantic city, that's my block, that's right|But on our block we still play||Los Angeles, aha, that's my block too|But on our block we still play|Oakland, can't forget Oaktown, that's my block for sure|But on our block we still play||And all the other blocks around this motherfucker|Houston, Florida, St. Louis, Tennessee, Miami, Chicago|All y'all niggas stay kickin' up dust|Representin' motherfuckin' blockEmbed"

The other officer Alexander Boyevich, is hospitalized with serious injuries||Hahhahahha I told you Muthafucka's I'd be back HahhahahahaYou might also likeEmbed"
