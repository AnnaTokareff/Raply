Machine Gun Kelly,The Return,2010,"The Return Lyrics[Intro]|And they say they know me...|Get the fuck outta here|Only God knows what I've been through, man|So if you wanna talk, get your facts straight first|And if you really wanna know, let me ask you something...||[Verse]|Have you ever walked in the shoes of a giant?|Or had to fill the position of a boss before you were even a client?|It's no wonder growing up under the roof of a tyrant|That I would be the poster boy for defiance|Now I'm the voice of the silence|Fuck being quiet I've seen twenty years worth of violence|I'm tired, it's a burden for me to open my eyelids|Not an undercover cop but it's safe to say that I'm wired|I can't even get a grip on my life with pliers|I'm fucked up in the head|Close my eyes cause I see demons around my bed|So depressed, open them up hoping I'm dead|Thought the fame would make it better but it only fucked me over|Never used to touch a bottle, now I'm hardly ever sober|People want to be my friend|But where the fuck were y'all when I was ten|Eleven or twelve getting bullied and beat up in the gym?|I couldn't never get a girl, now all the sudden I'm the man|Students try to get back cool with me again, fuck 'em all|Because guess where they're gon' be when my record stops playing?|Gone with the wind, off in the record shop saying that ""Kells fell off""|I knew it would happen, stop hating, cause a month ago you was all over my jock saying|That I'm ""that mu'fucker""|But now I'm whack, mu'fucker?|Opinions change, but you cannot change facts mu'fucker|If you want bullet points then call me a gat mu'fucker|I'll lay my whole life out like a mat mu'fucker|Man, I've experienced some things that would stop you from eating|My schizophrenic cousin tried to end my life while I'm sleepin|My bummy uncle wanna call now that he sees me succeeding|My momma left me for a teacher, lost my dad to the preaching|Half my friends are buried six feet, all the rest in the precinct|Literally watched my Grandmother die from Diabetes|I guess my prayers were answered when my Aunt got Cancer and beat it|Now I want to get her out a job, give her the garden of Eden|I did a lot of bad shit, God got even|But for the price I had to pay, I wish I'd stopped breathing|My girl sat in the bathtub, eight hours bleeding|Hearing the doctor tell us our child's heart stopped beating|Fuck a million, I wouldn't take a dollar for a life|But I will do what's in my heart, and trade this dollar for a mic|I wrote this song in hopes that it could help someone get through the night|With no intentions of getting paid, I'm just doing what is right|I do it for the fans, no, the real fans|Who stuck with me through the storm cause they understand|That there's a genuine pain behind the words I'm saying|And they embrace me, so I thank y'all for staying|Ain't it crazy, that passion is my achilles heel?|Either that or keeping it way too real|But they don't know how it feels, to feed off the energy of a crowd|Step on stage and they get loud|Dad, I'm gonna make you proud|I know we don't speak right now but I think turning new leaves is what we need right now|I love you|And you may not see right now but I'm begging for forgiveness, I'm on my knees right now|You saw your son as a dropout|Stuck around when I ran|Saw your son as a felon|Now see your son as a man|See your son be a father, to a beautiful child|Or just see your son Dad, see me smile|Who would have thought what started at the bottom would someday grow?|From three people in the crowd, unpaid shows|Six people in the room, one meal a day|Another opening act where no one knows my name|Saw the demos that I passed out laying on the ground|Saw the rappers I befriended copying my style|Saw opportunities pass while these fakes got rich|Now I can't stop speeding like my breaks ain't shit|For six months I went through hell and back|Right at the height of my success all of the sudden doctors said I couldn't rap|I had a polyp on my vocal chords|Left with a choice, stop now or possibly lose my voice|But I woke up and recorded every morning till my throat swole shut|Coughed blood after every show because it hurt that much|I went weeks without even saying a word to myself|No health insurance so doctor bills piled on the shelf|But for my daughter and my fam, and every single fan|I pushed through it, now I'm back for y'all again|As for my competition, this is the beginning of the end|But right now this is my return, amen|Kells|[Outro]|And they say they know me|Get the fuck outta hereYou might also like6Embed"

Aye Dub! Aye Dre! Aye Irv! you know it’s all year right? Hah! I'm sitting here in the middle of New York City, the night before I gotta turn my second album in, higher than a motherfucka, drunker than a motherfucka, with my boys, and I’m thinking, damn, man 5 years ago, we were dead broke chilling in Cleveland everyday, and the next thing you know, people are calling us about record deals. And you know, the crazy part is, Ashleigh rented this white Nissan Altima for me and Slim so we could drive out to New York. I think she had to some work some shit or something, so she couldn’t go so we were gonna go out there and see what these labels were talking about. And I’m driving us there, but my license’s suspended so I tell Slim, I'm like “Yo, I gotta pull up before we get to New York and switch, so you can drive in case we get pulled over"" cause we got pulled over the last time we went there. But you know, he had a license so it made sense for him to drive so cut to like 7 and a half hours later, I'm pulling over in this emergency lane and right as I’m opening the door to switch with Slim, boom! This fucking car going full speed on the highway swerves off the road and smashed into us. Yo, I swear to God I woke up half my body’s laying outside the car in the ditch, like 15-20 feet away from where we just were. The car was totalled, the windows were smashed, it was cold as fuck, it was raining outside, but we were actually okay. I mean, my boy had to go the hospital you know the ambulance came and shit, he ended up being alright, but our meeting’s with the record label started at 2 and we didn’t have no car, and now we were stuck in a fucking hospital in New Jersey. So this dude that, I ended up partnering with later on, his name’s James McMillan, he comes and gets us to these meetings and shit, somehow, someway. I don’t know if it was just because we just got into a crazy car crash and could’ve died a couple of hours ago but I'm in there and like you know I’m not feeling this shit man I’m not feeling this record label shit and we drove back to Cleveland. Now I'm back in Ashleigh's mom's basement, I'm thinking about life, you know, I'm on a shit ton of vicodin cause the doctors at the hospital you know gave us something cause we got into that car accident and Ashleigh runs downstairs and she’s like “Yo, yo, Kells, Kells, you're not gonna believe who wants to talk to you right now."" I’m like, ""who?” She’s like “He’s gonna call you in 30 seconds."" Now I guess, when I was in New York, I had made some kinda noise cause this dude named Byron who ended up becoming my manager later on took this video I had called “Chip off the Block” over to Bad Boy and showed Harve Pierre and Harve Pierre went and showed that vid to a guy named Puff, so I answer my phone, depressed, down, fucked up on vicodin and I hear: “Please hold, I have Mister Sean Combs for you."" I said, god damn, life’s about to change, man, I felt it. And sometimes thats all it takes, it’s just that feeling you know what I mean. I knew I was gonna be here, and now I’m here||Feel that, uh|Lace up, Kells|Lace up, Kells|Farewell, yeah|This that shit you bob your head to|This that brand new instrumental|I heard he puts his city on|That boy, Kells10Embed"
