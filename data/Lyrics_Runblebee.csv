Runblebee,Catch Me If You Can [Zero Gravity Ver.],2008,"Catch Me If You Can [Zero Gravity Ver.] Lyrics[Intro]||[Refrain]|No turnin' back, we are born to dream|In a world full of seeing what we never could reach|Air time makes on a wind, I'd be|Like life right by just a blur you see|One mind, too wild, stuck in divinity|Hawk tail, wing, claw — heaven sent a Jessy|A speed rush tweak to a melancholy, victory|Your chance don't stand|[Verse 1]|No one near my class of heat|The rule of the wind is to never get beat|Don't hedge, don't hog; you're put to the test|Like Jet, as hawk, I'll rattle your nest|I never come down, I'm high alone|Bred from a genie with wings and throne|Jet, fire hawk; the sky is me|All for speed I was born to be|Born to be! Born to be!||[Chorus]|Catch me if you can|There's no turnin' back|Reach, but never catch|Catch me if you can|You can't fathom that|Wonders you can have|Catch me if you can|Catch me if you can||[Refrain]|No turnin' back, we are born to dream|In a world full of seeing what we never could reach|Air time makes on a wind, I'd be|Like life right by just a blur you see|One mind, too wild, stuck in divinity|Hawk tail, wing, claw — heaven sent a Jessy|A speed rush tweak to a melancholy, victory|Your chance don't stand|You might also like[Verse 2]|Chaos in the emeralds, life is ephemeral|Whatcha gonna do? Nothin' is perpetual|World domination, advanced technology|Haven't got the interest in that form of glory|Put me in the air, and my speed will leave|All in a shine like a miracle weave|I just won't stop; the treasure's with me|I said it before, I was born to be...||[Chorus]|Catch me if you can|There's no turnin' back|Reach but never catch|Catch me if you can|You can't fathom that|Wonders you can have||[Chorus']|Catch me if you can|We are born to dream|Nothing can't be done||[Breakdown]||[Chorus]|Catch me if you can|There's no turning back|Reach but never catch|You can't fathom that|Wonders you can have|[Coda]|Catch meEmbed"
