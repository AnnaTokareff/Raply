K.A.A.N.,Kaancepts,2014,"Kaancepts Lyrics[Intro]|Kaan! Kaan!||[Verse]|'Nother psychotic episode, I need my medication|Hyperventilating, 'bout to have a panic attack in public|Discussing this with the publicist while I'm meditating|All I spit is heat, so is this room properly ventilated?|I'm killing your high the way that I murder a track, I never relax|You feel like you fucking with me and my flow, but you isn't my nigga that shit is a rap|Supplying a relevant fact, I'm taking that beat and not giving it back|I'm putting that right in your face just to reverse the verse I'm rehearsing|Disperse a curse, that's a MRSA for certain, I've been conversing|Confirming your inadvertent conversion within this version|Coercion and my persuasive perversion was a diversion|Assured it while I'm emerging, concerning my insecurities|I even said that last line insecurely|That's the second time that I wrote to this the potent is pouring out of my pores 'til the potion become proportionate force an abortion that’s purer than porcelain fortune abortion|I found within an assortment of force for fornication facilitating|A formulation of duress in a compilation|Predicted the proclamation, perfect my mental projectable|Vitamin for the fighters, injectable, not digestible|Address the microphone with the tone of any professional|Impressed with impeccable lines, every time, it's incredible|My rhyme's highly respectable, penetrating the posher|You pompous imposter, que pasa papa? I did it proper|While eating penne and pasta, call the doctor, I'm obliterating|While reiterating this honest pronunciation|Of reciprocation, the eloquation within my innovation|You should hasten all that replication, this is elevation|Like an application, I need to see your credentials|Massage a pen and my pencil, get loose on an instrumental|With sentimental, incidental, the sound was more intrusive|Wasn't conducive, I'll be the one never losing, coming at me with a lude, and never confuse it|I wanted to set the fuse, and given the realest of muse, never to be able to use it|There was no way to refuse it, given the voice said that it uses|But when I wanted 'em all in a piece in that vision I see when I see when I step on a beat that I'm making|I'm breaking, I'm giving them all I can say|But I do understand that the music is fake, created itself in order to relate|They love it or hate it, the minute we make it, we putting it out for the people to take it, and never would lead you astray?|A talent that I might display? We give it a round of applause|I said I'm trying to make the motherfucking world rise|With the rhymes that I comprise, the lyrics synchronize|The song compartmentalize, now watch it photosynthesize|Still in that state of infancy, I'm not looking for empathy|Why the fuck would you envy me? Empty the automatic for enemies at the embassy|Emphasizing the motion created within the energy|Enterprising my mind to the single pace to infinity|Venturing to divinity|Da Vinci with the vision, delivered with ill intention|But if you don't pay attention, I'm placing you in detention|Without an honorable mention, your ranks are filled with dissension, my bars are filled with dimensions|Demented like it's dementia descending upon defenders|For pinning a pawn dependent depicted within this sentence|I'm a mild man, a pacifist, massacring the masochists|Murdering, blasting the masses off to massive amounts|They'd probably give a better effort if they knew what really counts|But if you keep it real and build, then you'll put bills in your accounts|I'm not a mathematician — this written arithmetic|So I'mma teach you algebra, dumb it down for you simpletons|If (y = mx + me), then I must be|An MC that's obscene in my scene, but must see|I haven't even touched on the square roots of my averages|The 3.14 pi divided with savages|This ain't a dead democracy, my flow's totalitarian|Battling with barbarians, buried them barely breathin'|While coughing, wheezing with heathens, I'm digging ditches and heaving|Dirt over my left shoulder, you introduce a Jehovah|Suppose a foe that's in front of me started running and stumbling|Mumbling something out of his lips till I slit his wrist|And I tied him up to a cross and I started off with incisions|Insisting on silence for this crucifixion|The victim was tortured for hours, scorched by a blowtorch till the toes are burned to a fricassee|And now I'm carving all of the flesh, what's left of it's crispily|I'm vividly visualizing my victory|I'm pushing the vascular vein down to the main artery|The smell of death induces vomiting, I'm violent with a bayonet|Filleted his fingertips to get rid of the evidence|I'm pulling out his canines, molars, and bicuspids|While following in the footsteps of all of my fucking idols|From Jack the Ripper to John Wayne Gacy and Jeffrey Dahmer|The Black Dahlia killer and even the Cleveland Butcher|Who take a subject and slice it with a surgical precision|Even though I'm only kidding, I've lost faith in the music|And every song that I hear is amusing, it's so confusing|You would rather have a nigga acting like a buffoon|Give him a clown costume with the floppy shoes and the red nose|And don't forget the diamond chain to go with his expensive clothes|Perpetuating an image that no one can afford|Ain't you motherfuckers sick of that unoriginal ignorance?|I pick the microphone up and give you something that's different|Just open up your ears when I appear and start listening|It's Kaan|[Outro]|I shall leave you as you left me|As you left her!|Alone for all eternity, at the center of a dead planet|Buried alive… buried alive…|Kaan!

K.A.A.N.,Concealed The Outro,2015,"Concealed The Outro LyricsMy father used to tell me I was nothing more than worthless|A stupid motherfucker that would live without a purpose|Put my thoughts upon a page so I could try to prove him wrong|And every time I write a song I reminisce about the pain that I'm repressing in my brain so I don't have to feel alone|And I've been living with depression so I wonder how this shit really begins|I'm comfortable with the thoughts of vision and now it is||I've been working on this record for a minute|Still I feel like nothing that I do is good enough|My insecurities are creeping in so they would seep in to the music|Ain't it funny when other people see your pain as amusing?|Abusing many a pill and numbing the way I feel 'til the point of my reality's the furthest thing from real|The only thing I ever needed was a little piece of love and I couldn't find that in people so I would seek it in drugs|And I wanted to be the greatest instead I'm facing the truth|But the fact of the matter is that I'm losing it what's the use|And I know I'm sounding repetitive lack the lust for living|I pray that I be forgiven , I say let’s take a picture|For sinners to get the sentiment a critical acclaim to explaining  it wasn't evident|A premonition of my early death I'll make it prevalent malevolent confessing|And if I was down and out I can't sell my soul to be relevant|Gallivanting around like 'Fuck I'm finally free|I'm ignoring all of my problems|I said I'd bury them deep '|But I'm actually terrified and my paranoia was verified cause I just realized I don't wanna make it to twenty-five|A suicidal psychopath, a schizophrenic kinda guy that's looking for your empathy hoping that you'll remember me|The message I provided collided within the melody|A metamorphosism reliving giving debauchery|The resurrection of a savior coming out of Nazareth where you could catch a laceration and a crucifixion|Under what condition d'you make the decision moving like it's in a mild position living at the bottom wishing I was with it|Couldn't tell the difference|So tired of giving the false opinions|My faith in the book that was written by other people|They probably wrote with agendas|So every role was intended for anyone to follow|Attention, I got a testament|Just like the book of Mark|And I'm sparking a revolution|My story a revelation|Amazing, I'd rather save it, debate it|Everything on my mind|While I was taking a mental picture|OK, so my train of thought is evasive|I'm faded within my memory|From a daily addiction of always staying sedated and claiming I wanna make it|I'm nothing more than a follower|No apologies for it|Enforcing my fucking happiness|Don't know what I believe and I'm seething and barely breathing|I was thinking of positivity|The possibility that I'll be sane is like a fallacy|I got a way to go and I'm showing you people gradually|I been imagining a better life and then I contradict it|The consequence of feeling like a loser with no confidence|And I've been all alone, I'm tryna find the source of inner peace|I suffocate the beat until the flow has been consumed|I strangulate that mother fucker, turn the tune and turn the night maroon|And if I'm being honest, I think I'm losing my passion|I'm passing on opportunities|Giving in to distraction|The problem's that I've been having is all of it's a facade|It's quantity over quality|Profit over the product|But shit if it makes a dollar|Who gives a fuck if it's garbage?|We'll get it radio play and then now make it a classic|And take a nigga with talent that's about as big as a grain of salt|And put him on a pedestal|He'll eventually catapult to perpetual force|The actual result distracting|They forgot that mother fucker was never decent at rapping|They reminisce on the past and there ain't nobody original|But niggas stealing styles and never giving their credit|Accepting that shit's pathetic|A hypothetical pondering|I put it on a paper for some people I'm being honest with|Abolishing a novice and murdering his accomplice|A complicated affair with the notorious hitter|These habitual liars supplying a lot of ignorance|It's all about an image, so everyone's irresponsible|And if you got a positive message then it's impossible to overcome the current plan and rap a better obstacle|It's illogical to think that|The future is looking brighter|When money comes into play than the vision will get distorted|Cause you were forced into feeling by acting out of your character|You lost your sense of pride that's inside|Don't that embarrass ya?|Barely making it now when you're coming up from the rubble|Refuse to be in the rut|Ain't no need for an introduction|My shit is really disgusting|It's different and impeccable|Intelligent and highly respectable|You're susceptible to this lyrical giant|A tyrant acting defiant|I'd rather do this alone|So mother fuck an alliance aligning with preservation|To practice my dedication by defecating the delicate|Relegated with delegates to give them rigamortis|Supported within a deficit|Celebrated a reverence|Televising my decadence|From years of destitution|The resolution's irrelevant|It's gotten to the point where I can see that nothing's real at all|It's leaving me appalled and|I'm embarrassed I will get involved to mental regression for I have yet to evolve|Got to find a spot to put my aggression before I'm gone|But the pain that I feel has lasted so long|So by the end of this song I'm praying for my desire cause I'm refusing to fake it|I’d rather reform than retire so my generation remedial|I really can't believe this shit is happening|In any lie, I’m surrounded by fucking geniuses|And you gotta be kidding me|The only thing I was meant to be is the dopest mother fucker that people will probably never see|And if I never make it then I'm fulfilling the prophecy|Everything that I write has been centered around my honestyYou might

Vatican to sodomize the beat|And I bend it over the pew like a pedophilic priest|Sheesh!|A descendant of kings|No, I'm a pharaoh, that's part of Egyptian religion|That ended when Romans began to accept Christianity|I am omnipotent|Call me Osiris, the god of the afterlife|How I transitioned the regeneration that I resurrected|The message directed is truth for a liar, the way I am robbing|Distinctive attire, a crown on my head with the largest of feathers, I carry a crook and flail|If I fail it's a symbolic tale|A story I'm telling the King of the Living|My life, it was written on scrolls for the people|You step in my steeple to see sacrifices|I'm licensed to carry my pen like a firearm|Walk in a crowded building, I yell ""fire""|And fire the weapon I brought in my trench coat|I'm detouring people away from the exit|I shepherd them into nefarious flurry of|Bullets bombarded so pardon my pace|If you cover your face, then you hit in the sternum|Never really giving you a chance with me|Huh, Voulez-vous coucher avec moi (ce soir)|But manually I shall make a critique|My apostrophes are so magnifique|Beseeching the people, I need your attention|I can not progress if I don't have a crowd|I've allowed all these evils inside of my life|Man I used to be sober, what happened to me?|And I used to work harder then what I do now?|I don't have self esteem, and I feel insecure|I'm unsure of the person I am, I'm in need of identity|Fairly sedated, I fade to my former self back in '09 when I knew that I needed help|Very depressed I was so isolated|Not leaving the house, I'm not feeling elated|I'd much rather go get a razor blade|No, I don't use it for shaving|I use it for saving myself from the stress|And attention I felt 'cause I thought that it'd help|I admit that I'm down and I am feeling lost|Lawd!|[Chorus]|My confidence is low I am no rap god, rap god|Do whatever that I gotta do|I guarantee it isn't that hard, that hard|I gotta get better and kill it but I keep it real, no fa-cades, fa-cades|There ain't no competition I murdered this motherfucker Charles Manson, Manson||[Verse 3]|God, tell me why do I feel sick?|'Cause, son of a bitch, I stare in the mirror and cringe|Shit's getting worse, I need more medication|A mental vacation 'cause I can not take it|I'm holding my breath 'til I'm no longer breathing or seeing|I'm down to the ground and

majesty|Masterfully manoeuvre my movements, sure to subdue yah|Solution is you salute then follow suit my lyrics fondle you|Molesting your mentality, now you in need of therapy|Not to mention prescriptions to put you in a sedated state|You describe the insanity, informing them how I got away|You shake and shiver from the somber thought just how I put it|[?]|Now take us back to the place and the time of the crime|And tell me all about that maniac motivated maniacally|But biasedly beseech us with evidence of propriety|Priorly I was walking and minding my fucking business|And bumpin' ignorant rap about nothing another random ran|I saw him comin' so I ran, I never really had a chance|I tripped and took a look and he was standing with his frozen stance|The chosen man, they must've poked a hole when they created him|You gotta stop this nigga, he crazy, it wasn't happenstance|Or some sort of coincidence I was in that predicament|It's like he had predicted it all pause for the pitiful|He pointed to the pen and my pad and promised to puncture it|Started punchin' profusely, the reason that I was bleedin'|Believed that he woulda killed me if he had never stopped|I'm praying that he'll listen, I lay in a fetal position|Protecting myself from a blow to the body I'm feeling fragile though|He cracked my clavicle shattered some bones and broke a couple ribs|He said it's customary to cut the victim then watch'em leak|His stamina was something else, he sliced and he slashed|Causing contusions, bruises and gashes, I'm gasping for air|I tried to find the will to fight but he had taken it from me|I must've blacked out then woke up, got attacked by a vulture|His language was vulgar, I vaguely recall that, I called 911 no one answered the call back|I can't see, I can't think there's blood in my eyelids|My mind moving frantic, this man did some damage|My plan did not pan out, I pray that I don't see him again|He's about to blow up like Jihads|Insurgents from Islam, he's too calm, and so cold|The force was strong inside of this one, I never seen nothing like it|Enlightened by lack of resources, he had no fuckin' patience|Just pacin' back and forth my lifeless corpse in a balance|Adrenaline runnin' through me, and fuck it I'm feeling paralyzed|Apparently we met before he tried to explain|There's a decline within the music that had drove him insane|He couldn't take it anymore reflecting all of his pain|Inflicting the simple suffocation for ignorant publications|That praise and promote the popular even when it's a detriment|That's affecting the innocents, sentences to a simpleton|Little do people know what they're choosin' for entertainment|Is actually more subliminal than they had imagined|You couldn't fathom what the fuck we're bein' fed on the daily|But quick sidetrack they're tryna take the labels for ingredients|Off of the food we eat so that we can no longer see it|Ingenious, take the power of knowledge away from people|To put em in the position where they're completely dependent on every word that you say|And they treat it like it's an artifact|Jumpin' Jehoshaphat, that's intelligence and attention|Too much to ask of the people|I'm pleadin' that you believe in me|Easily I defeat the seat the scene was set for you to see|It wasn't filled with money, women and diamonds for jewelry|I swear that I intended to sooth 'em with something logical|Put it up in your mind so you know it wasn't impossible|To dominate the mind like a murderer by K.A.A.N. the ConquerorYou might also like2Embed"

prodigal sons, passing you prominence never puns|I promise I punish mine when I'm punching pages with pens|You can pretend, never assuming that you know me at all|A post-apocalyptic policy, Pentecostal apologies|Apostles prophesied from the power that I preceded|With Poseidon with the proper propaganda endorsed|I propose a toast with propofol to make a lethal injection|My flow could slice and cut your gut like a cesarean section|Very selective when deciding when to make an incision|I said my mind is an annuity, stories like Mephistopheles|My legend shall ascend to the level of Greek mythology|And everything is factual, pathological fallacies|Have never been allowed as I lie upon Zeus' cloud|And you follow this young Apollo that plays with a golden lyre|And I feel that I shall adhere to these allegations complicitly|A system I'm sadistic, cinematic's an atrocity|Simplistically consistent of sorrows and many sins of similes|And homonyms with Homeric hymns for your friends|And you feel it like sharp syringes, it's soft essence was soothing|It sterilizes the negatives, cerebral as a sedative|Inside my active mind, in time I find that I'm ingenious|Odysseus'

blasphemous|Bring it back, the flow is too amazing, I am innovating, you are emulating|You're insinuated, you are on the level, you can never be, as I proceed to teach|And I have built a fort that you can never breach|You wasn't ready for me, feeling incomplete, please don't compete, you will not beseech|You are obsolete, I am far from weak, my seinen represent to me|When it's looking bleak, be the first to preach, I guarantee, you can't crack my faith|Got up-scored taste, but the kid don't wait, my fate, if you really wanna hold your breath|Vocab impress, my mind's a mess, I stress about my death a lot|The solitary seat I'm spinning, it's sitting in Camelot|I'm the head of the table, decapitate with Excalibur|Calibrated my consciousness, it's of a higher caliber|Thirty feet in diameter, my poetic pentameter|Passes the condescending, it's consequences of misery|Viciously vindicate, liberate, but its expeditions leave as Plymouth Rock, the pompous place  this place composing my all|I picked the perfect hemisphere like where humanity start, and was innovated, raped, and pillaged, now it's dearly departed|Indigenous people possessing prominence that was regal|It was Kings and High Priests, but now we believe in Jesus|Blue-eyed and blonde hair for gentrifying the thesis and descending us to something, slaves, I cannot conceive it|But you take it as the gospel and think that it's concrete|We could start in Ephesians, Psalms, and maybe Ezekiel|Now let us testify when you died as high in the sky|It was documented in Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus, Now in the beginning, God created heavens and Earth|It was formless and filled with darkness that reigned all over the surface, the spirit of the omnipotent hovered over the water|Divided the day and night and then said ""Well let there be light""|Now ain't that great, but where's the evolution of that verse|And if it was written by a man, well then there's lies in them words|I think that we were given religion so we questioning less|Obsessing over all of your instincts, worry about what they think They giving false repentance like it mattered at all|Not to mention many wars that all these deities started|As we crusade into to the current, I noticed the recreation of ignorance in the mind of this impotent generation|I think that I'll take it deeper, look how you viewing these places|Of infinite destitution, no resolution for poverty|Your Western Ideologies, only causing illusions|That's similar to mirages, remarkable mental martyrs|That marginalize the struggle, a load that you never carrying|So everyone that's from the middle east is now a terrorist|Embarrassing that you can't even see what it is|We from a place that takes the culture that we don't understand|Then tell the people how to live and while we raping yo land|And taking every natural resource you have at your hand|And you can have it back, of course, it's for a discount price|There's no remorse within the fact that we have ruined

and percentages|Pity plenty of rappers|I’m cockin' back and extracting|The bullet is metamorphic informin' you of the rapture|They capture a simple bastard and place him down in the pasture|A pedicle’s for the passer to pass them off to the coroner|Try to corner the marker, cathartic Catholicism, apparently it's appalling|Averring to your appearance, appearing as the imperial|Prepare the proposition and compare us in a map|It's effecting my opposition, but the money’s a facade|And it's a captivating vision|To capitalize upon the way that other niggas livin'|But the truth is in my

It’s all that I've known|With the lack of attention I got in my home|Not to mention experiences I’m repressin'|And I wish that it wasn’t the way that it is|All I wanted was happiness back as a kid|But the longer I live I can see there’s no sympathy|Come here to sin and pray god has forgiven me|How to survive or exist in this misery|Agony sure to accompany me|I like to write all my philosophies|So then I organize them with apostrophes|I say the flow is real there’s no anomaly|And I’m a new Davinci with a masterpiece|I brought a Mona Lisa, that’s a bonus feature|With a bogus preacher and a larger posse|And a few surprises, give me kamikazes|I’ll be playing blind and swaying in the hammock|Like I drank it all and now I’m feeling nauseous|My words are slurred so proceed with caution|Libation in me, then in starts embalimin' my mind|Convulsing and now I’m evolving to a different person|I don’t even like him and my car is moving through your territory|I’m familiar with it, but I feel like a tourist|In the driver seat but everything look foreign|And I realize that it was never for me|I won’t change and I’m not conforming|One hit of acid with a few blunts|And my nigga Jake could give two fucks|With my windows down and these tools up|Masking emotions that I got inside of me|I’m no better than the rest of society|Please do not place me on top of a pedestal|Meet me in person you’ll say that I’m pitiful|Always complaining or take it for granted|I’m not satisfied and I don’t understand it|I barely managed to get out of bed|And I don’t have a plan that’s going to get me ahead|I cannot see the future I live in the past|I confess that I’m mentally sick, but you son of a bitch|Do you actually think that I care about numbers|Or if you are playing my shit|Man, I treat it like therapy, this is my session|The pen is dissecting my singular thoughts|That I took out the vault and I put on a page|Only ‘cause I want to give you honesty|I’m tired of these sickening motherfuckers|They’re preying upon the weak|And I beseech you with intelligence|I pray that you can feel it|I’m the realest and a villain that’s giving out his opinion|Only if someone is willing to accept the boy|Instead of giving out hate or reject the boy|I told ‘em give me a minute for some reflection boy|And you have tried your best, it don’t impress me boy|You’re like the rest of them that I see through|And that’s transparent, you should be embarrassed|Call up both your parents for some home training|There is no excuse for that sad existence|We are not the same, I can’t tell the difference|Nigga everybody on the internet|They’re giving out illusions and|You’re buying and flashing a miniscule moment of life|But you have no idea what the rest of it’s like|And you try to keep up and make sure you deliver|Now you gon’ be just like rest of them niggas|I break this shit down so follow my instructions|Ignore your reality that shit’s disgusting|Start living a life of heavy self destruction|You work at McDonalds but flash all the cash|That you got on your check that you owe to somebody|When you take the picture make sure that you’re smiling|That money right next to your face now you’re cheesing|That twenty on top of someone’s underneath it|Put a filter on it so people believe it|And don’t get me started on scandalous women|You don’t have a job but you want, you want men|So you’re taking that picture for your Instagram|And you’re checking your hair to make sure it’s on fleek|And you wonder why these niggas calling you bitches|And why they would treat you the way that they do|Like you’re lower than dirt, look at the length of your skirt|Never let someone else define your worth|You do not think you’re in need of companions|Baby girl there’s men all over the planet|Eventually somebody will understand you|Demand your respect and develop some standards|‘Cause darling your pussy is ruling the planet|But that's till it's ran through by niggas and bandits|That you let hit quick and then they start abandoning the ship|Oh, now you’re lonely as shit|‘Cause you don’t have love for yourself|And you search for your soul then I hope that it helps|But if you cannot grasp that it’s not about wealth|Then you just might be in this position forever|I stare in the mirror, can’t get it together|I’m losing my mind and I need to get sober|I don’t have the will and the way that I feel|It’s like fuck it, my nigga it’s already over|I, coulda took my time to make something for you that's average|The masterpiece I molded was motivated by madness|The depth of my disparity and clarity is varying|I should have justified it with the truth but I’m aloof|And I’ma do what the fuck that I feel is really necessary|And I want everything that I was ever denied|My shit

realest of rappers that get on the beat|With the way that I murder the flow and I show when I go at incredible speeds|I'm something that you never seen, my lyrics are mean|I'm turning 'em all into fiends, and giving a villainous scheme|They hearing the scream, I said that I'm reigning supreme|The fuck did you mean?|A nigga is living the dream, I'm broker than ever|It's not getting better they give it a maximum effort|Dependent upon the endeavor, they faker than fuck|And I said that I'm feeling the vibe|A lyrical Jekyll and Hyde is really alive|I craft a masterful sentence like a scientific formula|Form of the fornication I formulated defacing|Then pacing, taking my time but I'm tryna develop patience|Preposterous that your ponderance possibly wasn't vacant|Mistaking my dedication for degradation with decadence|Destitute and aloof I'm eluding ever-evasively|My focus and concentration taken with inconsideration|Here's the situation, I could be a future constellation|Minus consternation, this sentence has just been consummated|Confiscated from the complications of my confirmation|Guess my conversations are compilations of records|Was lacking some type of content, they wanted the realest of concepts|The way that I spit it I said it at convents, enough of your nonsense|I'm coming up quick with this shit and I'm giving it quick, the music is filling they clips|I think I'm accustomed to hate, 'cause people are fake and that's why I can never relate|The time that that took to create|The passion I have is the reason I feel that I'm great|Was given at birth, determine a personal worth, they said that the flow wouldn't work|Instead I'mma leave 'em immersed, I'm putting my pain up inside of a verse|I'm dotting my I's and I'm crossing my T's|I'm one of the best that nobody has seen|They came in to know me fatigued, the moment they leave, I said that I'm taking the lead|But why are you looking confused, the beat is abused|Now wait you amused, the fuck was the literal muse|I'm giving a beautiful view, you came in the game with a crew|I do what I do and I'm doing it better than you, but I thought that you already knew|I murder the beat and I said that I rip in it right, it's everything that you like|I masterminded a massacre, manifested majestically|Mutilated your majesty, marginally imagining|Fathoming you could ever step to me but never recklessly|Or disrespectfully accept to dissipate discrepancies|I speak insistently as I simplify for the listener|Sympathize with the sinister, magnify it for menaces|Maximizing the minuscule, minimal effort given|By rappers making a living, for instance I been insisting|This game's in need of assistance, persistence has been the difference|The time I put into my sentences so you remember this relentlessness|Offended with pads, pencils, and pendulums|Popping pills of prescriptions, proprietors of addiction|A crucifix oughta fix 'em, that's automatic forgiveness|An artificial confession that's purifying your senses|What I spit is A-I-D-S, are you impressed?|My flow's an immune deficiency as I officially|But more specifically proficiently, even known as prolifically|But I'm envisioning that|They loving the way that I'm making it drop|I come for the tip of the top who wanted the nigga to stop|They give a ridiculous plot, he's stirring a line|And whether I like it or not they fuck with the way that I rock|I'm taking my time when I murder the feeling|The realest of niggas to be in the building|The illest of villains, defending a phony is fame|They giving a sickening claim and play an erroneous game|As I'm resurrecting my name|My lyrics they bang, I'm leaving a nigga to hang|I'm knowing you take it in vain, but let me explain|I'll tell you the reason I came, it wasn't for taking the blame|I said that I'm working your brain, they feeling ashamed|As I was remaining the same, I told 'em I would never change|I feel like I'm going insane|The point that I'm wanting to make is that niggas are fake|And I finally found where they made a mistake|When they focus on everything but the rhyme|And not really taking they time, the way I design my intricate difficult lines|I bet that I'm blowing your mind, but what do I find|These niggas don't listen to mine, they telling me I'll never shine|I wanted to make it sublime, they told me that that was a crime|Arrested if I actually try, convincing myself that I'm fine|Condemning the way that I rhyme, I guess I'm ignoring the sign|But there was no one that could find these niggas that giving you lies|But nothing I'm seeing is real, I'm telling you what I despise|My nigga, I go to the fullest extent and I'm getting revenge with a pen|And I'm telling you stories and sins, that I'm living my life with no friends|Sellin' lifestyles over half of these companies, of course it's for a couple fees|Nothin' I hear but logic can actually fuckin' comfort me|Audacity to think that I could make it in this industry without a label backin' me|Doing it independently but my dependency|Upon the music is confusing, conflicted by what I'm viewing|And what the public is choosing, they're puppeteers of careers|And these strings are made of veneer so I'm making it crystal clear|That my future is what I fear 'cause I know I'm destined for loneliness|Hopelessly, I devoted my time in a pipe dream|And it seems that my aspirations were actually asinine|With the hours that I have wasted, should have listened to the niggas that said I would never make it, they taking my lack of confidence and try to call it modesty|Never display my talent|I'm tryna die nigga, honestly, ironically|I'll probably never have to do it by myself, my local government will help|And they're not interested in my mental health 'cause nowadays|It's legal to murder a nigga for wearing a hoodie and eating some Skittles|They heads' in the sky but a nigga went out with a bullet that came from an ignorant cop|And I'm wondering when this'll stop, killing my generation with they shots|That isn't a shock, disgusted by what I am watching|Wondering if I see this from a cop that they'll capitalize on the shock in the streets|The land of the free and the home of the brave, at least for the people that's paid|The pain and the poverty causing disdain, it's simple and plain|It's in a residual change, and everything is the same|I'm telling the truth, so why the fuck does no one listen|Killers who wearing a patch that was given to them by the sickening system|Ha, yeah|You might also likeAnd right now I ain't nothing, I'm

that I'm never gonna make it|A man left vacant from all the pain he concealed|I said it with the validity, I felt as though I needed, defeated by everything I go through|I don't even know you, speaking with a figment of my imagination|Tryna find my soul, everything that I will say up on a record|Is similar to assembling a reason to live, I pray Christ forgives|And this life I'm in, devoid without a purpose|Diverted but not emerging, immersed in the agony|A life, I can never get it right to enlighten and I fight and finding the peace|My release is the music, and now I need a muse|Refuse to give you something you consider less than|Confused that you'd believe in the words of the next man|Amused that you would listen and tell me what I am|I don't even understand, cause I was never connected|I'm gone and complacent|The way that I've been living is off of the reservation|The stay of the state of steady evaluation|Evasive, I wish I wasn't isolated, so sedated, filled with hatred|Still retracing all the mistakes that I made|And never make 'em again, I thought that|I wanted friends, but people only appear when they see|That it's beneficial, dependent on emotions|That I am willing to give, I'm getting close|To insanity|Everything is cynical, sending em a better sign|The pain is never subliminal|Seriously invested, I'm resurrecting correcting a policy|A personal put the place, I deface the abrasive, you cannot erase this|The moment that you put in the ground, and I made it|The times ain't change, and it's always gonna be the same shit|Give a negative image that you are guaranteed to receive in an abundance of wealth|Attempts to cover insecurity|That you have currently felt|Materials never helped|They're only there to mask it, manifest, manipulate, relevate the energy|Praying never reciprocates|I'm working to eliminate the mindstate perpetuated by literal ignorance defended it by saying you playing it for the beat|And the lyrics they never matter you seeing as obsolete|And we seeking to see the center a hypothetical sinner with theoretical lineage to emphasize the innocence, a suicidal nigga, to be honest I don't give a shit|I'm really getting sick of it simmering every time to the world When I need to be alone to atone for sins and trespasses|Can I get a pastor|You ain't gotta say it I know I'm a fucking bastard|Prepare for the worst I feel like I'm ready for hell|I'm a different type of nigga that's very easy to tell|I think I'm in need of help|For pills to ingest for instance: my intent?|End it all, nigga|Been praying to God for the false repentance invented and said it was an anomaly impossible to proper the pain is part of the problem|Presented as a constant|I got a lot of secrets that's sitting upon my conscience|Call it what you want but it better be the truth|Never lie upon the nigga that was living in reclusion|Everything I do is amazing, it's no illusion|Whatever niggas given the vision has been alluded|Damn I cannot breathe|All of the evil I see is source for my apathy actually feeling like I'm insignificant|I am not different, never been better|A lack of intelligence, taking its toll, is embedded inside of me|Suffering silently see my demise is a way to be free|A depressing confession connected|The sentence malevolence given in my adolescence|Compressing the session until it's affecting the words that you have for the due convalescence|With question obsessing the day I expire|Retire from livin' submitting my spirit affirmatively till I'm permanently in a place of seclusion|I cannot tell what is real as I fill up the page with the prophecy|Pardon the protestant lacking the sympathy making obvious deal with the consequence|I just pray my death is quick I'm a son of a bitch and I'm dying the way I was born|Told you I never depend I can't wait for the moment that I meet my savior to tell me this is the end|I just wish I was no longer here is the cause of the pain and the source of my fears|Lord|[Bridge]|And I'm just searching for that, I never got when I was...|And I'm just searching for that, I never got when I was...||[Outro]|And I'm just searching for that love I never got when I was young|And I'm just searching for that love I never got when I was young|I'm at the end and I don't know if imma make it out alive|I'm at the end and I don't know if imma make it out alive|All these years of isolation drove this young nigga insane|All these years of isolation drove this young nigga insane|Said I don't think you'll ever understand my motherfucking pain|Said I don't think you'll ever understand my motherfucking pain|Said I don't think you'll ever understand my motherfucking pain|Damn!You might also likeEmbed"

K.A.A.N.,4for1,2015,"4for1 Lyrics[Verse 1]​|As a child I dealt with abuse, I'm fusing pain with the mic|Felt like the world was on my shoulders, took attempts on my life|I understand that isn't healthy|Like, how the fuck could it help me?|Reflecting as an adult and realising I was selfish, but|You couldn't tell me no different|Try all you want I'm not listening|We had no shelter or place we could turn|This shit is routine and the lesson I learned|Is keep your mouth shut, the more quiet you are|No yelling or screaming inside of the house|Cause that wasn't ever allowed|See, I wasn't raised to believe I could possibly be anything that I wanted|There is no support for the kid with the home that is hectic|We were dissented|Tell me the way I should go|Everything I should already know|All the emotions I'm willing to show|My adolescence, progression, and growth were stunted|So I'm feeling mentally stuck|I live on the edge and I don't give a fuck|A handful of pills, that was never enough|The way that I cope with this is living this up|But if I recall we had been through it all|You niggas are speaking no problems of poverty|As if you actually seen it|But bitch, when we lived in that trailer we never had nothing but roaches around and we couldn't complain|My parents would bicker, it's always the same|My mother was picking us up after school|We'd be in the back of that old station waggon|96.3 on the radio blastin'|Smokey Robinson would have us relaxin'|Quiet Storm before we step in the madness|All of the peace that we had is now past us|Walk in the door but there's yelling and screaming|There wasn't a place where I ever felt safe|And I couldn't relate to the kids that I saw|Cause I felt that they all had it better than me|Cause they don't have to deal with the shit that I deal with|I stay in the middle of arguments|Shitting myself and believing this shit is my fault|Every time they would fight it was grief|Closing my eyes and my ears in my room|When I opened them up, man, that shit never ceased|And I want to be free but there's nowhere to leave|I wondered why people keep fucking with me|Cause when I was in school they would tell me I'm slow|Cause I never attend anything I was told|So they put it on me like that shit was my fault|Cause there couldn't be something that was in the way or the place that I stay|Cause I never got help|My mother got tired from busting her ass|Like, dropping us off and then going to work and then picking us up and then bringing us home|To a man that appreciates nothing at all|While he burning a cigarette, staining the wall|Monday through Saturday crushing us all|But gets up on Sunday to go praise the lord|But there's no time to time in those moments to spare|I figured it out, that life isn't fair|So do what you can|Cause nobody cares|It's all about loving the memories that you have made in your happiness while you are here|I pray that you live without fear|And you never think you're in need of materials just to complete you|Cause that ain't the truth|Don't be dependent on things that can dissipate or disappear when you need them the most|Lawd! Ey, knowledge, nigga|[Verse 2]|Look here|I've been the man for a while|My definitive plan|And I'm attentive to my terror lyrics of part too quick|Style constipated, I could never give two shits|Coming through your speaker like you need to go ""Who this?""|Now you need a nigga that's only giving you elegance|I gotta kill 'em, regulator, moving with malevolence|I try to paint a positive picture while feeling negative|A sedative, I soothe 'em, assuming that I'm a sinner|While sending you serendipity, I live in misery|I'm playing Mister Misdemeanour, changing my demeanour|Feigning for the fountain of youth|I wanted wisdom and truth|I know these other mother fuckers try to give an excuse|But my style is too loose, prefer to be reclusive|I give a simple sentence, serenade ya with acoustics|I been showing the way but nobody is tryna follow me|Believin' what I'm doing, I'll never make an apology|I built the foundation for a fuckin' mauseoleum|With a citadel and mural like the Roman Colosseum|Infiltrated by an infidel, I'll see ya when I see ya|Sippin' White Zinfandel|I'm a connoisseur and conqueror|A commodore with the cadence|Occasionally I kill it|I'm giving you food for thought, it's enough for a starving village|My image you won't acknowledge|The mileage up on my brain|Time for an all-chain|Now pay attention, I switch it|Efficiently give a vision|The mission is motivated|I make it a point, I plan it|I done managed to manoeuvre|The music is too melodic|Don't play it for any novice|I'm modest? My nigga, never|I focus on getting better|Embarrassing anybody|You niggas plotting for profit|And politicking with others, evasive is what we are|I'm working but never seen|It's all a part of the plan|There's a method to the madness|You'll never understand|I can spit it any way that I want|But you thought I want the flow they never really noticed|When you giving up your time|And in your mind you're thinking ""Man, I'm just a Diamond in the Ruff""|I know it's hard, you're feeling down|But when you get above the ground|I guarantee that you'll survive with nobody up on your side|Whenever you do decide you finally feel alive|We in love with the truth, we never telling a lie|I promise to give you honesty for the rest of my life|You might also like[Verse 3]|Man, I swear to god I would never give you nothing that was average|A young black savage|Fast rap bastard|Either way, you see me as the master|Owned a plantation, delicious destruction|My shit is salacious|Distribute discussions, attributing to how I think I can function|These guys on the internet think they did something|Oh no|Time for me to put them in their place, quick|Lyrically impeccable, punctually embracive|Face to face, your fade, it fades, refrains to fame is fake as fuck mistakes that I make|I gotta work with that selective amnesia|Focus on the test and follow all of the procedures|Maybe I'll take a break cause I'm tired I want a breather|I know these evil mother fuckers would like to deceive us|Jesus are you there, do you hear a nigga talking?|I been calling you for years but I feel you just ignoring|Like telling your secretary, ""Jot it down, he's not important|Take his name and his number and tell him I'm busy|I'll call him when I can|If I ever get the chance|If he's giving you attitude then just fuck him in advance|I ain't blowin' him up|Cause I know that nigga needed me for forgiveness of his sins|He need a pen and wanna run but he dependant on the pain|Cause that's all that he's got man, I know that's the truth|Subjecting myself to silent solitude|With no silence inside of me, soon to subdue|I'm submitting myself when I plummet|I pray they put poems inside of my casket|My posthumous spirit is piercing my peers|Don't adhere to the fear|Or the feel I appear at the peak of a pyramid|Pissing on pitiful peons for penance|There's plenty pretty petty pressing matters that I know that I need to address|My sobrieties|First I get I high in excess|That don't equal success|It just means I feel less than alive|I'm surprised that I made it as far as I have when I'm lacking a moral compass|Ain't ashamed of my past|Still remember when them niggas told me I was trash|I wanted to spit a couple of bars, but I'm aware that they would laugh|Now I never think about them cause all I did was surpass them, lawd!|[Verse 4]|I said I'm tryna make a way|I need the world to make a masterpiece|The devil's on my ass|That dastardly deviant chasin' me|Replacing my emotions|I'm motioning towards the negative|My nepotism navigates|I'll never reach the narrative|Your negligence is never necessary|It's nefarious|The window's getting smaller|Looking down a narrow barrel|Bullets flying like an arrow|Allocated by your hatred|Hindering the possibility to possibly make it|Aye please, when you rise, tell me what the fuck you really see|I pray that you can recognize and find spirituality|Hoo!|Don't you know fatalities and fallacies are definitely on the way?|It's babies killing babies basically|Cause don't nobody think I know they have secret agendas|To generalize a people of color|Formally cover but covet cash and account for a drinking|A diamond link|And give them all the tools they need to make sure that they become extinct|I try to tell all of my niggas|We are an endangered species|But am I the only one that sees or actually believes to see this|Sick and in my seat I seem to see the seed they planted|Plants are thrown out of the window of a moving vehicle|I mean I veer and steer|A benefit that fear is fabricated|Face it|Base it in my lease of predjudice and poorer confidence|Ignoring the injustice of a judicial system|That puts a race of people away at a rate that's faster than rabbits|Attack it from the inside, destroy a black family|Contra' did a lot of hurt that we have not recovered from the 80's|They put drugs and guns inside of our communities|At least the inner cities to make sure there isn't unity|Confusing that you think this isn't a genocide|We statistics mother fucker but we in need of some rest|And I supply the sentiment if there's actually any left|Cause it's either incarceration or seeing an early death|In the depths of my soul like the test of control like a test|I've been tested, they lessen the blow|On the spot they align and combine as a full|While exposing a posing impressionate person you'd personally|With their personal preference|No pardon for peasants presented for people to place an opinion|Of pitiful, pungunt, disgusting provisions|I need to prepare as I peek with a pair|That's my pain and my passion, you cannot compare|Is it clear that I'm here?|Cause I hear that they heeding my messages|Heated with heathens, they heavin'|A heater to heat up the block|And then chop when they eat up the people|They call up the cops|But they can't stop the evil|There's forces at work that will not embrace change|It's insane how they think all black people the same|Lawd!||[Outro]|Eh! 4for1. That's it. T-that's it. Next week we gon' give you 5for1 then the week after that we gonna give you an entire mixtape that's just one fuckin' track.

LORD!||[Verse 3]|Please don’t ever confuse it ‘cause I’m going to do it like a rapper never did it|When I finish the beat'll be in a critical condition|Medical attention to the point that it never survives|I’m barely alive and never revived|When I’m buried with a very crucial crucifix|I’m losing my religion in the moment|And I’m praying for atonement of the sins I committed in the past|To wash away all my pain, I’m finally free at last to relax1Embed"

relapsed|I rehashed the issues a nigga never dealt with|I wanna survive, it’s like I’m barely alive|I’m lost inside of a typhoon|Feeling helpless I’m so selfish|I’ve been relentless, defensive|My

gracious|Emaciating, interpretation, my flow is a guillotine how I decapitate it|Irregulate it, regurgitation of anything that I was creating|This procrastinator will stay sedated|To mask my emotions I'm feeling up on a daily|And I could give a fuck if a record label paid me|I wanna make a connection to people that's real|And give 'em food for their soul, that's something that you can feel|Imagine the passion of packing a promise|But what you are lacking is focus|Please don’t ever think about distractions|And pay attention when a nigga rapping|It’s all about the self-preservation, your effort,

third degree|Brought 'em in then into a fricassee|Fan inflates to inhale the heat|Get away from my kitchen if you can't take the humidity|It's dark in hell, it's hot, I let 'em rot beneath my fucking feet|See under the circumstances, I raise the standards and stand alone|For this type of dialect, to decipher you need Rosеtta Stone|My head is a war zone, I go Rambo, I feel likе Sly Stallone|A literal kamikaze, all carbon copies I kill the clone|Celebrated on TV, e-mail, CC, retweet, keep the receipt|Repeat, repeat, don't you believe, don't buy bullshit, that's E.B.T|Not human, I'm more like E.T. royalty like Nefertiti|TNT, B-O-M-B, behead you, you no longer breathe|Feeling the energy shifting with sentences, said I'ma send him a similar syllabus|Set up the syllables, make it invisible, I'ma go in until I see the pinnacle|Prodigal pen with the pies, pivotal, kick it the most when you doin' the minimal|Never distracted by data or numbers, the motive is moving, I'm reaching the summit|I'm an outlier, a top-notch prize fighter|My attitude's nothing to lose like I'm a lifer, housed to Rikers, third striker, [?]|I shine bright like headlights and highlighters|It'll get a little rocky ASAP just like Rihanna's fetus|Whenever I speak, they clap, that's onomatopoeia|When it comes to rap, I snap, damn I leaked a litre|Let my people eat while I burn leeches, compose speeches that'll leave you speechless and sleepless|What's up under my sleeve is something so deceiving, it shock your system and cease your breathing|I'm the reason you should rehearse your verse before you speak 'em|Call the nurse, call the doctor, call the pastor, call the deacon|I could get analytical and give you a logical method to explain the madness|A matter of mathematics with offensive pattern|Put a fork in the bitch when I'm finished|The way that I'm spitting, I need to go seek a dentist|From the mouths of the bench like it's calisthenics|Said you couldn't catch me if you're weak winded|On my worst day I'm in first place, give 'em first aid, you're in need of it|I resuscitate 'em, blood circulating, heart palpitations, 'bout to save the patient|Put 'em under the knife, I do surgery, surgically make an incision|Insisting I'm really ready chopping like machetes, flowing like I'm Fetty|I go over your head when I feed 'em the medicine, give 'em the sedative|Put 'em to bed where they numbing the pain if it's relative|Most of these motherfuckers on the quest to be relevant|No I do not feel the sentiment if it ain't about my betterment|Fully aware that I am in a dirty game, for the fame people change|Women lie, men lie, the numbers get re-arranged in the name of unspeakable things|I really [?], surging, gotta watch for the serpents lurking|But this shit is a circus like Barnum & Bailey's|It's certain, that I will rise up from the ash, [?] , I flew right past|Go to the max, I won't relax|Release these flows, I do just that|Believe the ground I walk, it crack, that's to the core, I make impact|Gotta shift like tectonics, giving out content, gotta reach every continent|I'ma kill 'em with no conscience, unresponsive to all of these consequences|Roundhouse kick at your shit to make you flip take you out of it|I could make you slip your disk, I don't miss, I hit you then slit your wrist|Like a real cease and desist, make you quit|Inquisitive minds insist that I get back on my shit just like this, and I'm staying on top of it|Topical topics they giving, they're tiring|I live in the lion's den, I'm battling with the beasts never the novices|Avoiding the politics, all of the hypocrites, all of the heretics|The rhetoric that they give, I don't believe in the shit like an atheist|My faith is in two words, six letters, that's Hip Hop|No cross over, flip flop, mainstream dickriding|Kissing cock with a French liplock until it drip drop|Looking to get ahead but instead you came up with nothing|They wanted the glory, they wanted the fame, 'cause it goes together when it's one in the same|And they wanted the money to get through the shame, it's embarrassing giving up morals for fame|And you running in circles, you going away, gotta find a direction that put you into position|Play the victim and put you into submission, there's a feeling of defeat|The reality you see, realizing you won't be at the top, it's appalling|At the end of the world it's really a small thing, you are no king|In the deep end with a small boat, if you can't swim then you will sink and you will drown|When it goes down, I am one of the ones that is profound|So it's me, myself and I like pronouns, prolific profile|I noticed the way that they feeling my style, that's no coincidence|Connected to the gift of the spirit like it's Corinthians|I'm giving a ceremonial rebirth like it's a christening|I've risen to the task to attain the skill to amass, to amuse the masses and masses|I mastered the art of rap, it's a masterclass with a winner|Like Master Splinter, I taught 'em young|The best is yet to come, this a marathon that I run|Ready to regulate like the CDC or Nate Dogg and Warren G|These flows like CPR, that's a breath of fresh air I make 'em breathe|On point like CP3, how you handle shit is a major key|My rhyme schemes intricate, in succession of notes like a motif|The re-occurring symbol, it's simple but yet it's seldom seen|It's something so serene but it's really cerebral|As you see, that's elementary like 1-2-3 or learn the A-B-C's|They pondering the possibility of what it really means|One of the fan favourites, one of the game hated, one of they foul flagrant|Running around with the devil like I'm Van Halen|I am reporting live like I'm Van Lathan from the local station|Spreading that sound all across the nation, let the people play it|You see the way I am displaying abilities only given to a few|And I'm chosen, they chilling, they fake, you can feel it|In fact it's a formula that I have fortified|The flows'll leave you mortified, a fortress that I've built inside|The lines of the composition, pay attention to the rhythm|[Outro]|Yes god|Knowledge, nigga|""But remember, don't hesitate

baby wipes and pampers|Boy that means I'm the shit|Got a urethra full of Ether, poisonous when I piss|And I'm accurate, I never miss|I dismiss 'em quick when I'm torching it|Correlate with a few from a destitutional view|And what I do is dominate like my name Ndamukong Suh|I pursue, consumin' the coon that was cool with kickin' some ignorance|Cut the head off of a thief that was stealin' in front of witnesses|Leave 'em in disbelief as I mutilate you [with grief]|If I cease in seizin' the moment, I'm sure attention will leave|And intent is to see me falling' in autumn on top of leaves|I mean

stole from somebody|That rapper they stole from had stole from somebody|We are all derivatives, I am aware if it|No originality, it's embarrassing|When will they see this shit, nobody studies it|Hip Hop is Pop now-a-days and you loving it|Guess that I'm [?], I roll with they [?]|The next time you see me, the scene will be seedy|I seem to subdue while confusin' the greedy|I really don't get it [?]

consume me|Soon to be a [?]|For the fact I fucking snapped and slapped a [?] for talking back|Attackin', take the heart from them|They lack the arsenal to win|An arsonist with narcissistic tendencies

[?] it, and quench my thirst and my hunger|I'm longing for something more so can some one send me a sign|'Cause I'm really having a difficult issue dealing with time|In addition to the attrition afflicting me in my mind, fuck|I can't breathe nor think right now|But I'm making the most of the time that I get|If I live like I did when I cut my wrist|Then I just might trip and you don't want that|I black out and do some things I don't remember usually|I used to see the world as a beautiful organism|But that was in '96, I mean shit I was just a kid|I've convinced myself that it's hopeless, I'm well aware that it is|I can feel the Devil, he's screaming, he's coming right at my neck|As he offers diamonds and cheques|And he tells me that they'll respect all the fucking art I create|But man I refuse to accept it, I'm not a vessel of hate|I'm just venting upon these pages|Apparently people feel that my poetry is preposterous|Probably pressing play and applauding when I am posthumous|Generation of followers, only fuck with the popular|Problem is that this populous glorifies the demonstrative|Dominate, I'm a deputy|Destitute with a debutante|Destined to be indebted to [?] many credit cards|E.B.T in amenities, [all for] Benjamin Franklins|Frankly I'm a man of sin|Medicated with medicine|Mescaline for your Majesty|Maddeningly, 'cause I casually|Murder beats in this

assistance|You think material wealth and I pray for my mental health|I had hopes that Jehovah could hear me|I fail my test and assignment|He's given me many talents for that I should be appreciative|Instead I ignore it and only focus on the negative responses and the comments|Fuck that I'm givin' a masterpiece|Make the rest of them mad at me|Said I'm one of the realest to do it|I

deformities|Formulated the plan for avoidance of the conformity|And I can put the cots in the corner of dormitories|Deploring that negativity|Given in your fragility|Lyrically my ability|Showing off
