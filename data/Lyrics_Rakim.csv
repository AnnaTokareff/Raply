It came|In the form of a thug in the game|To create a strong position, there's blood in my vein|The chemical is identical, we one and the same|With seven letters in all three of my government names|Walk on water? Nah, neither did Jesus|It's a parable to make followers and readers believers|From Egypt to Budapest, Rakim is the truest left|Understand the Scriptures like the minister Louis F|I told you who God is, you ignored me like most the prophets|Jesus, Solomon, Abraham, Moses and Muhammad|I showed the scholars, we'll fulfill the broken promise|I spit this truth to predict the future like Nostradamus|Like Revelations, I'm hoping my quotes reveal|The seven spirits of God when I open the seal|Interpret the holy Quran, these flows will guide you|Translate the Torah, and decode the Bible|Warn the elders in the mosques, masons, and the law|The seven churches, the synagogues, it's the Renaissance|Skin is bronze like the Messiah|Rakim Allah's about to reveal the biggest secret in time: Men are God|You might also like[Chorus]|Holy are you|Holy are you|There is no God but you|There is no God but you|Praised be the LordEmbed"
