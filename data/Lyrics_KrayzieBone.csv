Cuz I don't really want 'em in my zone|Originally original 'cause it's my own|Somebody better tell them that them other niggas fakin' and they really mistaken, nigga, that's not Bone|Sick of these so-called rappers comin' with watered down shit, foul shit|Somebody should've learned 'em all, not to never come around this with that clown shit|So I had to show 'em with the rhythm and the melody, there will never ever be another Thug-N-Harmony|Everybody do it now and it don't really bother me 'cause they already knowin' I'm the leader of the artistry|Real in the streets, I keeps it real in the booth|Yeah and even that 9 millimeter I carry, it still spits the truth|Nigga, don't test me, I'm not an experiment, your curiosity may be innocent|But before you niggas try to run up on me, I'm an incredible, hell of a lyricist|And it's impeccable, and they can never deny the sound, it's so respectable|Have you heard this scary deadly flow? That's the reason all them other niggas want to catch the Boat, float on|I been savin' these rappers from sinkin' ever since I came in the game|And it ain't only rappers, it even some singers that's singin' like us when they sang|Even producers producin' the beats with the double time, makin' that bang|So why in the fuck is they actin' like we ain't the reason that everything changed?|Way back in the days well, it came from East 99, the beast, they deny me|And, really, I never had to be awakened 'cause they fell asleep on a giant|So I came back and showed 'em that I was the chosen one and they should never defy it|I'ma rock 'til the beat stop|I'ma make 'em feel it when the beat drop|You better bring a cold drink 'cause the heat hot|Nigga, y'all better think 'cause we not but we retaliate|And the shit was kray 'cause it was really Kray|Keep it real, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?|I fucks with Kanye, I fucks with Jay|I fucks with Lil Wayne, I fucks with Drake|I wanna have a ménage, I fucks with Nicki|I wanna rob a couple rappers, I fucks with 50|The flow was out of control, so I fucks with Kendrick|I fuck with Mos Def, he fucks with lyrics|I fucks with Eminem|I fucks with T.I|I fucks with 2 Chainz, hey|I fucks with Nipsey|I fucks with Jeezy, but not with you, Mane|And I'm fuckin' with A$AP|Remember the matter remains that, I tell em that Leathaface still in this bitch and I stay hittin' hard as a train wreck|Wait a minute, you probably thought I was finished|With me it’s never a limit|The killer make sure you stay dead|This killer flow that be the gimmick|The illest of any minute|The realest, so many feel it|The lyrics really authentic|So potent that when you get it, you cough or choke when you hear it|I'm knowin' them niggas fear it 'cause I got up in their spirit|I told them niggas in the beginning that I'ma kill'em with 2000 words in 2 minutes, pin it|Who that nigga running with the AK-47, packin' power like a Smith & Wesson 357?|Heat, so heated heavy that these competitors are never ready|I'm like a disease, I keep spreadin'|I hit 'em like a headache or a migraine, watch a nigga die in the flames when I set it, deadly|Burn them to Hades, and learn 'em that Krayzie, ain't never afraid, who scared?|Rockin' like a real rapper, then I put a little Jodeci in it and say, ""Ooh Yeah“|I never wanna be a star, I rather kick it with the real niggas|Chillin' with the field niggas|Get that dollar bill nigga|If I got to kill niggas, then you really finna meet this steel, nigga|Comin' 'round the corner with the gun and you’re a goner|'Cause I'm more than a performer, sendin' rappers to the coroner|So I give 'em all a warnin' when you see a nigga stormin', comin' at you with an attitude, all you gotta do is saluteYou might also like21Embed"

forever|I hear home calling back for me|If heaven really had a cell phone|I'd pick it up and hit up God and ask Him what's happening|I apologize for all of this madness|Speaking on behalf of all of my family|World so crazy, everybody angry|Thinking you deserted, everybody say you ain't here|I been tryna tell them you be always on the level|World ran by the Devil, I be yelling but they can't hear|Everything mixed up, need to be fixed up|And all the politicians say they got the answers|But every time they vote em' in it didn't matter|Cause then it show em' once again it don't matter|I just wanna let you know before they tryna hold on|I already know you know it even though we may not show it|But can you tell me what am I to do when everybody is pursuing all this wickedness you said we shouldn't do it, do it||Just sittin' back thinkin' while up, Hennessy is drinking, done a whole lot of livin'|I done seen many schemes, chased plenty dreams, I had done a whole lot of sinnin'|It really make me wonder how I don't go under|Tryna stay alive and survive through this thunder storm|But what did I do, what did I do wrong?|And my bad, man?|Cause I tried to get the things I never had, man|Was dealt the bad hand|But I maintain my life and changed my life|Even with these cards, I play the game write|Could you please shine one of your blessings down on me?|My life is a mess, many levels of stress and I really could use one now|You might also likeTonight, I feel like sin I'm finna get into|But see that's what the Hennessey & gin will do|And I've been scoping|You already know

I'm losing the light and my sanity|Maybe it's cause I'm living the life that might damage me|Tell me what you gon' do for me?|What if I need to hold something too?|Could you do for me like I always do for you?||Let's just sit back and do nothing at all|Let's just smoke to the good life|Can we sit back and do nothing at all?|Can we smoke to the good life?|I love this new wave that we on right

remember my daddy told me, ""Say boy, you need to get up and go get you some""|So I went out and got me some|And when I got it, make sure that I got a lot of it|Cause life you can only live it once|So you need to get it done|Before you know it, they don't know you no more|They never knew ya, you feel just like they treat you like a stranger|Act like they true 'til they can't use you no more|That's how they do ya|Sometimes it really sucks to be famous|I guess everybody gotta take they fall from grace|So just know, that one day, we all fade away|I knew rappers used to be active but they gone today|It's the coldest thang|Nobody loves you when you find out when it's over that you really have more foes than friends|It's a cut throat game, It's cut throat game|Any second you could be thrown away, blown away||It's the most potent love I ever had|It's like a different dope I never had|She like two daily doses of whatever's bad|And make me feel so good, I ain't never mad|Oh please, oh please, can I get just one mo hit, huh?!|I don't mean to be greedy but I need me just one mo fix, ma!|I think I'm addicted cause dog I forever be in it, a fiend to the finish|This shit is ridiculous, I'm sick with it, I need intervention, detox|To claim myself what she got is something else, I relapse|It just keeps calling me back no matter how hard I try|These things, ya'll got all ya'll offtrack but I need more|I'm coming back, I'm running back||I think I'm living in a nightmare|And you the villain so I think I'm captain save a hoe|Don't think you right ma'am|Don't think you loyal like you claim to be, I can't do it|I don't need no obligations, complications, I've been through it|Don't have patience for you fakeness|Bitch stop faking, stay true to it|Fake hoes, they so foolish|They hoes, exactly what you is, Jezebel!|She my Billy Jean bitch, beat it!|She phony and conceded, I don't need it|And a girl be for some other nigga, run the game on the sucka nigga|Cause I'ma learn ya, I ain't fuckin' with ya|I rather talk to myself, I rather walk by myself||Why you be constantly grabbin' at me|Stabbin' at me like gravity, tryna trap me, snatchin' at me|The Devil is laughing at me, evil happenin, jealousy be the reason, bitches scandalous|Money's another reason niggas savages|They want what I got, I tell them, ""Not happening""|And I make sure the haters stay so far from back of me|But they always come after me|Everybody wanna pull a nigga down|They wanna live it when a nigga down|Wait, but chasing this paper, ya'll niggas fake and Krayzie's gon' shake ya, straight out the game|I'm tryna make major, never let a nigga never think they can fade us|Yes, I can feel your gravity on me cause I get way too high||We just tryna fly through the sky, come lets float|We tryna stay high, rise way higher than most|(X2)|Rise way higher than most|(X4)|Step in the party, I'm tryna get me some liquor in me|I got the feeling that I'm finna go over my limit|And never underestimate me cause I got it in me|I know how high I can go|I usually get it started after sundown|Forget about my problems 'til the sunrise|And let me live the life at least one time|I'm like how I high can flow|I got money in the bank|So I can still get high|You keep thankin' what you thank|Cause I'm gon' pop this bottle|You keep drankin' what you drank|I got a little bit of weed though|It's medicated so it's legal|So we can creep, sneak out back|Roll up, blow that sack, sack of fire, fire|We just tryna fly through the sky, come lets float|We tryna stay high, rise way higher than most|(X2)|Rise way higher than most|(X4)||We was partners from the start|Hurt my heart that you're not here|And it's all cause you my dog|This one thought brought me to tears|Anytime I squad I call|We show balls and how to fear|Now your name highlights the wall|There they reach rest in peace yes deceased|I can't believe you're really here no more|Because in my mind, at any second you'll come through the door|It's all in my mind|I see you waiting on this miracle|Cause I know in time|I meet you, greet you in the physical|So I take flight|And we stay high|I take flight|And we stay high|There's no good explanation why your time had to run out|I can't believe that you're gone now|I think of you like you're still around|I call your name but there's no sound|Stop, look, listen|There's no sound|Hope God will make it clear one day, why he took you away from me|I wish I could rewrite the way|I wish there was a way to change the story|(X5)|It's crazy||When the world is on your shoulder|I'll be there I'm your soldier|A friend like I'm supposed to be|To the end I rise, so row for me|I'ma be right by your side while everybody else is runnin' and hidin'|I'll be frontline|I'll be your light, be ready to guide ya, hide ya|So no mo pain can find ya|When you forget you the shit, I remind ya|God developed, designed ya|Look at yourself in the mirror, you're shinin'|Bling, bling, bling|Lot's of friends, we have them|But do we really have them?|Cause most em' are just past tense||I been really thinkin' different to the niggas that they claim that they running the game|I'm looking at them like they lame, they all in the same|I give a fuck about your fame, don't come in my lane|Cause I'ma lyrically kill em', and put one in your brain|I'm the nigga that created it, even today|These other niggas imitated it, even the braids|Now that shit Kray|So you better put a little respect on my naaaame|I guess they thinkin' since a nigga that forty somthin'|That I wanna load that on em', but I guess I gotta proven you a lie|Grand daddy swagger|Ready for battle, no man better, never no tongue badder|Have a never (?) cause anybody can lose it|I'm the nigga that proved it, a nigga that can do it|And we gon' keep it real like that for 'Pac!|To me, all competition dry, they suckEmbed"
