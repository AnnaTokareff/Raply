With his white contacts distinguishing him from his peers, he was signed with Ruthless Records from 2006 through to 2009, leaving due to numerous issues with the label, and its head, Tomica Wright. He co-founded his own independent label, Funk Volume, whose roster includes such artists as SwizZz, Dizzy Wright, DJ Hoppa & Jarren Benton.\n\nIn early 2016, Hopsin took to social media to talk about how he was going to leave Funk Volume because of problems with his Co-Founder Damian \u201cDame\u201d Ritter and would start his new record label called Undercover Prodigy, that wasn\u2019t just a record label with merchandise, but an entire clothing line as well."

Your lazy ass don't commit to labor\nYou pick somethin' up, try it out, and put it down two minutes later\nThen you complain about your life 'cause it ain't gettin' catered\nNow whoever tries to call you on your bullshit's a hater?\nYou wanna succeed, you have to try; or one day you'll get older\nAnd regret it all 'cause you can't provide\nYour friends are lowlives, don't act surprised\nLook, just cut the bad fruit off of the tree, make the sacrifice\n[Verse 2]\nGirls, stop actin' like you want a guy\nWith traits like Romeo \u2014 bitch, that's a fuckin' lie!\nYou always talk about how every man's fake and you can't take it\nAnd you want somethin' real \u2014 shut up, tramp, save it!\nTwice a week you put on your makeup and damn bracelets\nAnd head to the club half-naked with your ass shakin'\nPullin' a lowlife nigga who claim he cash-makin'\n'Til you let him hit and find out he work at the gas station\nOne of them niggas got you pregnant and you can't raise it\nBut you caused it, your actions made a fat statement\nYou want Romeo, then act patient\nAnd stop frontin' like he in the club posted in the back waitin'\nIt's the club, where guys put on a new persona\nAfter they get loaded with a few Corona's\nThey always shoutin' and wild out\nWith habits that very few condone of\nThen they look for beautiful brainless bitches like you to bone 'em\nThen when they leave you, you cry and cry\nTalkin' about, \"Oh my god, I can't find a guy!\nI've spent so many years and I've tried and tried!\nWhy am I even on Earth? I should die!\"\nYou want Romeo, you're not worthy\nYou're cock-thirsty, you're nasty and probably got herpes\nSometimes the secret to findin' is to stop searchin'\nTry a new formula, 'cause your last one's not workin'\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nThe term \"real nigga\" is publicly used\nAnd I need to know what it means, 'cause I'm fuckin' confused\nAre you one for always bustin' your tool\nWith nothin' to lose and somethin' to prove\nTo homies up in your crew?\nIs it because you're sellin' drugs to get loot\nAnd brag about how you done been shot and stabbed\nLike it's fun to be you?\nBut your life's a struggle, right, and you just hustlin' through?\nNah, you hamster-ass nigga, you just stuck in a loop\nMan, why do black people gotta be the only ones who can't evolve?\n'Cause you in the streets actin' like a neanderthal\nIt's clear you can't stand the law\nYou're lost as an abandoned dog\nAnd all you're interested in is fightin', rappin' and basketball\nI can't even fuck with you\n'Cause if we out in public, you gon' get caught stealin' some shit, and get my ass in trouble, too\nYou'll get old and be nothin'\nLivin' life in these streets, thuggin'\nAnd starting shit with anybody mean-muggin'\nLook at you, a real nigga, thinkin' your life's cool\nGirls used to turn me down for guys who were like you\n'Til you grab their heart and shove a spearhead right through\nThen they regret it because it wasn't the right move\nYour \"real nigga\" talk seems bogus\nA real nigga don't brag about being real as long as he knows it\nAnd his future doesn't seem hopeless\nA real nigga stays out of jail, handles shit and he keeps focused\n[Verse 4]\nTo all you rappers whose soul is out in the wrong\nYou inspired the issue I wrote about in this song\nYou go to prowl on the young who roam around in the slums\nSee, this is what happens when rap's overcrowded with bums\nHope the hour is long when I'm rollin' out with your tongue\nThe man above is my guide, you know the power is strong\nAll you menacin' freaks are only in it for cheese\nAnd the mass-control limit was breached \u2014 fuck hip-hop!\nThey only in it for cheese, and any eyewitness can see\nThey purposely makin' the innocent weak\nMy existence on this planet's for you, I ain't only here to benefit me\nYo, we need to make a change while there's still time\nIt is hard, and sometimes I struggle tryin' to reveal mine\nI can guide you if you feel blind\nI just need you to be willin' to journey into my ill mind260Embed"

    "plain": "Yet another addition to Hopsin\u2019s Ill Mind Saga (and what looked like the last we\u2019d ever get)\u2014this song focuses on two general subjects\u2014religion and government. The song details his religious beliefs, views on other religious beliefs and ideas, and the connections between religion, history, and governance.\n\nIronically, the music video was produced by a man named Moses Israel, these two words both being heavily entrenched in Christianity and Judaism, which is an integral part of the song\u2019s religious theme. In the book of Exodus in the Bible, the Israelites who left Egypt wandered the desert for 40 years, because they were lost in following God. Here we see Hopsin is in his own desert, lost and unsure about his relationship with God.\n\nIn an interview with Hard Knock TV, Hopsin said:\n\nI made the \u2018Ill Mind 7\u2019 just talking about how I kinda' like fell out of Christianity and the reasons why I question everything. The song is still a cry for help in a way where [I\u2019m saying] God, I want you to be real, I want you to be real but I just can\u2019t trust human beings. So please like tell me something."

I\u2019ll just expose the truth\nI'm so close to the fuckin' edge, I should be close to you\nBut who the fuck are you? You never showed the proof\nAnd I\u2019m only fuckin' human, yo, what am I s'posed to do?!\nThere\u2019s way too many different religions with vivid descriptions\nBeggin' all fuckin' men and women to listen\nI can\u2019t even beat my dick without gettin' convicted\nThese ain\u2019t wicked decisions, I got different intentions\nI've been itchin' to get it, I\u2019ve been given assistance\nBut the whole fuckin' system is twisted\nNow I\u2019m dealin' with this backlash because Marcus isn't a Christian\nAnd I\u2019ve been told that my sinful life is an addiction\nBut I can\u2019t buy it, it\u2019s just too hard to stand beside it\nI need an answer, humans can\u2019t provide it\nI look at the Earth and Sun and I can tell a genius man designed it\nIt\u2019s truly mind-blowin', I can\u2019t deny it\nIs Heaven real? Is it fake? Is it really how I fantasize it?\nWhere\u2019s the Holy Ghost at? How long\u2019s it take a man to find it?\nMy mind\u2019s a nonstop tape playin' and I can\u2019t rewind it\nYou gave me the Bible and expect me not to analyze it?!\nI\u2019m frustrated and you provoked it\nI\u2019m not readin' that motherfuckin' book, because a human wrote it\nI have a fuckin' brain, you should know it\nYou gave it to me to think, to avoid every useless moment\nIt was a mission that I had to abort\n'Cause humans be lyin', we're such an inaccurate source\nIt\u2019s gon\u2019 be hard to put me back on the course\nNext Jehovah\u2019s Witness to come on my porch I swear I\u2019m slammin\u2019 the door\nA lot of folks believe it though, but I\u2019m not surprised\nHumans are fuckin' dumb, still thinkin' that Pac\u2019s alive\nI ain\u2019t tryna take your legacy and torch it down\nI\u2019m just sayin', I ain\u2019t heard shit from the horse\u2019s mouth\nJust sheep always tellin' stories of older guys\nWho were notarized by you when you finally vocalized\nNow I\u2019m supposed to bow my head and close my eyes\nAnd somehow let the Holy Ghost arise? Sounds like a fuckin' Poltergeist!\nShow yourself, and then boom, it's done\nEvery rumor\u2019s gone, I no longer doubt this shit, you\u2019re the One\nI\u2019ll admit that my sinful ways was stupid fun\nAnd all my old habits can hop on top of a roof to plunge\nI\u2019ll donate to a charity that could use the funds\nFuck the club; instead of bitches, I\u2019d hang with a group of nuns\nAnd everyone I ran into would know what I came to do\nI wouldn't take a step unless it was in the name of you\nI hate the fact that I have to believe\nYou haven\u2019t been chattin' with me like you did Adam and Eve\nAnd I ain\u2019t seen no fuckin' talkin' snake unravel from trees\nWith an apple to eat, that shit never happens to me\nI don\u2019t know if you do or don\u2019t exist, it's drivin' me crazy\nSend your condolences, this is me reachin' to you, so don\u2019t forget\nIf Hell is truly a pit of fire and I get thrown in it\nI\u2019ma prolly regret the fact that I ever wrote this shit\nMy gut feelin' says it\u2019s all fake\nI hate to say it, but fuck it, shit, I done lost faith\nThis isn\u2019t a small phase, my perspective\u2019s all changed\nMy thoughts just keep pickin' shit apart all day\nAnd in my mind I make perfect sense\nIf you aren\u2019t real, then all my prayers aren\u2019t worth a cent\nThat would mean that I can just make up what my purpose is\nAnd I could sit in church and just say \u201cfuck\u201d in the services\nMan, what if Jesus was a facade?\nThen that would mean the government\u2019s God\nI feel like they\u2019ve been brainwashin' us with a lot\nSo much that we don\u2019t even notice that we\u2019re stuck in a box\nMan, everything is \u201cwhat if?\u201d \u2014 why is it always \u201cwhat if?\u201d\nPlanet Earth \u201cwhat if?\u201d, the Universe \u201cwhat if?\u201d\nMy sacrifice \u201cwhat if?!\u201d, my afterlife \u201cwhat if?!\u201d\nEvery fuckin' thing that deals with you is fuckin' suspect\nI\u2019m fuckin' done!\nI\u2019m fuckin' done!\nThis is my fuckin' life\nAnd I\u2019m livin' it, I\u2019m havin' fun\nIf you really care for me\nProve that I need to live carefully!\nBut I\u2019ll be damned if I put my own pleasure aside\nFor an afterlife that isn\u2019t even guaranteed\nWe are you, and you\u2019re us\nStop playin' games!\nMy life\u2019s all I got\nAnd Heaven is all in my brain\nAnd when I feel I'm in Hell\nMy ideas are what get me through pain\nDo as you please, and I\u2019ll just do me\nI\u2019m a human, I\u2019ll stay in my lane; Ill mind\n[Chorus]\nIt's us, find power\nLive life, mind power\nIt's us, find power\nLive life, mind powerYou might also like430Embed"

    "plain": "The eighth installment of the Ill Mind Saga addresses Hopsin\u2019s falling out with Damien Ritter\u2014the co-owner and CEO of his label Funk Volume.\n\nTheir falling out came as a surprise to fans, with Hop posting multiple messages Janurary 2, one reading:\n\nI\u2019ve been having issues with my business partner Damien Ritter. We started this whole FV shit years ago, but this man has all the sudden built up the courage to disrespect me and tell me I don\u2019t work hard when I\u2019ve made him Extremely wealthy over the years from my music. At this point, if he doesn\u2019t leave funk volume, then I will. I\u2019m putting it out there publicly so he knows that it\u2019s fuck him forever. If ur a real Hopsin fan, I need your support right now and I only hope u continue to strongly support me if/when I leave FV. My heart will always rep FV, but as of right now, it\u2019s not home for me as long as Dame is apart of it.\n\n3 days following he posted again, this time confirming the untimely demise of FV, writing:\n\nFunk volume is officially dead now thanks to the monster Damien Ritter. There is nobody else to blame at all. I have officially separated myself from everything and I am fully independent now. It\u2019s very sad but idiots like dame wanna control too Much and now he end up destroying a great fuckin team. Having a crew like FV has been my vision since I was 14 years old and this man just destroyed it. Jarren, Dizzy, Swizzz, Dj Hoppa and I are all still on good terms. They will forever be my brothers and I support them in whatever they do. I will let u guys know the full story soon. You know ama keep it RAW for real. Ain\u2019t no holdin back. Im so sorry to all the FV fans. There\u2019s a brighter future though.\n\nOn March 3rd, Hopsin went on social media to announce that he\u2019d be releasing this track on March 8, 2016, this coming as bit of a surprise as he previously stated there\u2019d never be another."

       "plain": "The eighth installment of the Ill Mind Saga addresses Hopsin\u2019s falling out with Damien Ritter\u2014the co-owner and CEO of his label Funk Volume.\n\nTheir falling out came as a surprise to fans, with Hop posting multiple messages Janurary 2, one reading:\n\nI\u2019ve been having issues with my business partner Damien Ritter. We started this whole FV shit years ago, but this man has all the sudden built up the courage to disrespect me and tell me I don\u2019t work hard when I\u2019ve made him Extremely wealthy over the years from my music. At this point, if he doesn\u2019t leave funk volume, then I will. I\u2019m putting it out there publicly so he knows that it\u2019s fuck him forever. If ur a real Hopsin fan, I need your support right now and I only hope u continue to strongly support me if/when I leave FV. My heart will always rep FV, but as of right now, it\u2019s not home for me as long as Dame is apart of it.\n\n3 days following he posted again, this time confirming the untimely demise of FV, writing:\n\nFunk volume is officially dead now thanks to the monster Damien Ritter. There is nobody else to blame at all. I have officially separated myself from everything and I am fully independent now. It\u2019s very sad but idiots like dame wanna control too Much and now he end up destroying a great fuckin team. Having a crew like FV has been my vision since I was 14 years old and this man just destroyed it. Jarren, Dizzy, Swizzz, Dj Hoppa and I are all still on good terms. They will forever be my brothers and I support them in whatever they do. I will let u guys know the full story soon. You know ama keep it RAW for real. Ain\u2019t no holdin back. Im so sorry to all the FV fans. There\u2019s a brighter future though.\n\nOn March 3rd, Hopsin went on social media to announce that he\u2019d be releasing this track on March 8, 2016, this coming as bit of a surprise as he previously stated there\u2019d never be another."

(What the fuck?)\nHomie, I made you rich, paid your rent (Damn right!)\nBitin' the hand that was feedin' you\nThis shit don't make any sense\nNigga, what the fuck? (What the fuck?)\nYou know this is that real shit\nHow you gon' forget who built this? (Huh?)\nI'm the one who made the company all the millions\nNow you got problems to deal with\nMan, this is tough luck, see a couple weeks ago we was buds\nAnd the crew that was killin' shit was us\n'Til you turned on me, homie, that's fucked up\nI ain't keepin' this shit on the hush, hush\nOn my chest I just carry too much stuff\nI done had it, enough is enough, bruh\nPlus I needed somethin' to get my buzz up\nYou done fucked with the wrong dude\nAin't no tellin' what Hopsin is gon' do, creepin' up on you\nQuit your sleepin', I told you\nThis a mothafuckin' journey we finna go through\nIf I ain't have so much to lose\nI swear to God I'd probably beat up and choke you (Damn!)\nNigga, this is that raw shit (Right?)\nThat organic flow you probably see up in Whole Foods\nShiver me timbers, somethin's fishy 'bout you, Mr. D Ritter\nWhen I told you that I wanted new management\nWhy the fuck you throw a fit and seem bitter?\nWhy you catch an attitude whenever I question you\nAbout all my fuckin' percentages?\nI know why (Why?), you've been bendin' it\nIn your benefit\u2014your honor, I'm innocent!\nThis nigga crazy, I'm tellin' all of my people (You tell 'em!)\nHe takin' all of my C-Notes (It's true)\nSee, he has a gamblin' issue\nHe takes the cash and blows it all at casinos (Damn!)\nUh-oh, when I bring up my royalties\nYou start avoidin' me, that's some disloyalty\nYou woke up the evil boy in me, your ass is poisonin\nTell me why you would destroy FV?\nThis was a fuckin' vision that I had created with your brother\nBut you too infatuated with the money\nYou killed it and ran it straight into the gutter\nNow I think, \"Why'd I make D\u2014A\u2014M\u2014E the boss?\"\nYou keep pissin' a whole lot of people off\nOur whole label came out with a weak result\nYou on that same bullshit Tomica brought\n[Chorus]\nNigga, I don't know what you thought\nYou think I can't see the blood on the walls?\nBlood on the walls, that ain't goin' down, nigga\nI don't know what you thought\nI can clearly see the blood on the wall\nBlood on the walls, that ain't goin' down, nigga\nAin't got time for your bullshit\nEverybody knows you be on it\nAin't got time for your bullshit\nEverybody knows you be on it\nAin't got time for your bullshit\nEverybody knows you be on it\nAin't got time for your bullshit\n\n[Interlude]\nHold up! Hold up!\nI got some more shit to say, yo\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's supposed to be Funk Volume, isn't it?\nThought it was music above all the business\nBut you just said: \"Fuck all you niggas!\"\nYou tarnished the brand\nAnd you started a Funk Volume Fitness?\nCome on now, really think\nGot us portrayin' somethin' we really ain't\nHow we supposed to be ill\nWhen you on our website with a Shake weight\nTryna be Billy Blanks\u2014nigga, thanks!\nFool, ain't nobody tryna lift weights\nWe just wanna hit up the studio and just rap and do shows\nBut you don't understand the culture of hip-hop\nYou a lame-ass nigga, Dame, half the crew knows\nNew-Age Jerry Heller, a scary fella\nI hate your fuckin' name, every letter\nI'm very fed up, you actin' like an ordinary heffa\nI'ma take you to the mortuary dress-up\nWe gave you our trust, then you had us cornered\nYou got us a shitty label deal with Warner\nAnd if I confront you about it\nYou tell me I need counsellin' and I got a disorder\nYou sent me on tour and it's horror\nShitty hotels, no sleep, with no food to order\nMeet and greets every single day, it's torture\nHow you expectin' an A1 performer?\nEvery time somethin's wrong it's the same thing (What?)\nBlah-blah-blah-blah, you just blame me (Damn!)\nThen you tell Brooklyn and Jammie (Damn!)\nNow they both thinkin' I'm crazy (Damn!)\nI deal with this on the daily (Damn!)\nMy career mentally rapes me (Damn!)\nI won't let this nigga break me\nHe prayin' Dizzy Wright is gon' replace me, shady\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nWhat are your fuckin' motives, Dame? Let's talk about it!\nUmm, you're our manager, our label-owner, our accountant\nHmm, that's kinda tricky\nSomethin is fishy, that's risky\nWe just don't even know\nWe go with the flow while you rowin' the boat\nYou keepin' it simple-minded\n'Cause you knowin' our only concern is just hopin' we blow\nSo, when all the money come in from our album and tours\nYou sit there and soak in the dough\nWhen did we ever ask about the gross?\nWhen did we ever ask about the net?\nYou would just hand us money from our shows\n'Cause you knew we wasn't questionin' the checks\nNigga, I trusted you with my life\nYou upped your percentage, so I'm makin' less?!\nFuck you, bitch, you get no respect!\nThis is why Hop is comin' for your neck (Bless!)\nAll you care about is makin' money\nYou don't care about a fuckin' soul though\nYou just fluctuate our dollars up and down\nAt your convenience like a fuckin' pogo\nYou been screwin' everybody on the label on the low\nAnd they don't even know though\nSo, good luck, Jarren, Dizzy, Hoppa, SwizZz, I'm goin' solo\n[Chorus]\nNigga, I don't know what you thought\nYou think I can't see the blood on the walls?\nBlood on the walls, that ain't goin' down, nigga\nI don't know what you thought\nI can clearly see the blood on the wall\nBlood on the walls, that ain't goin' down, nigga\nAin't got time for your bullshit\nEverybody knows you be on it\nAin't got time for your bullshit\nEverybody knows you be on it\nAin't got time for your bullshit\nEverybody knows you be on it\nAin't got time for your bullshit\n\n[Spoken Outro: Joel Osteen]\nChange is one of the most difficult things that we face. But change is inevitable\nOne reason we don't like change is we get comfortable where we are. We get used to our friends, our job, the place we live. And even if it's not perfect we accept it, because it's familiar. And what happens is, because we're not willing to change, we get stuck in what God used to do, instead of moving forward into what God is about to do\nJust because God's blessed you where you are doesn't mean you can just sit back and settle there. You have to stay open to what God is doing now. What worked five years ago may not work today. If you're going to be successful, you have to be willing to change\nEvery blessing is not supposed to be permanent, every provision is not supposed to last forever. We should constantly evaluate our friendships. Who's speaking into your life? Who are you depending on? Make sure they're not dragging you down, limiting you from blossoming. Everybody is not supposed to be in our life forever\nIf you don't get rid of the wrong friends, you will never meet the right friends71Embed"

You get no props on it\nIt sucks so much I get blowjobs from it\nI been told you niggas, \"I'm real!\"\nIf you wack and no one's confronted you\nOn your bullshit, then I will\nHate on me, but you can't deny skill\nI crush all the momentum that you guys build\nWith my eyes sealed\nYou faggots got me cussin'\nAnd only reason you probably buzzin'\nIs 'cause you slave as an Illuminati puppet\nY'all really on one, beat it, you're gone, done\nYou think real niggas feelin' your shit? C'mon, son!\nI'm the illest and that's fo' shizzle\nMy flow sizzles, your boy Hop go hard like some cold nipples\nYou niggas are makin' it so simple\nMy swag makes the ladies wave\nLike fat stomachs with bold ripples\nI know you niggas wish you could prevent it, 'cause I get buck like my Kool Aid's got way too much sugar in it\nYou better run like I'm booger-flickin'\nHomie, I've been good at rappin'\nNow I'm tryin' to get gooder with it\nSo I'ma just go beast, and bring that West Coast heat\n'Cause I'll be damned if you flex on me\nThe radio is filled with garbage over techno beats\nAnd all these songs about cash are what we just don't need\nYo, nobody care about how much money you stack\nI murder everything I touch, buddy, move back!\nGot enough guts to sew trash and bust up your fluke act\nAnd leave your fans sayin', \"How the fuck does he do that?\"\nMy rankin' is vicious, you thinkin' it isn't?\nCome pay me a visit if you feel that you may be offended\nBaby, I'm wicked, crazy and sick\nAnd with the face of a nimwit\nI be callin' out names, but I ain't takin' attendance\nSome bitch was like\u2026\n[\"Some Bitch\" (Hopsin)]\n\"Hop, you got me cryin'\n'Cause you said I could call you\nWhile you out on tour, shit, and I be tryin'\nI even text you, but you not replyin'\nSo when your new shit finally drop\nThat's one album I will not be buyin'\nWhat, you're too Hollywood?\nAnd you don't even have two minutes?\nEver since you got your buzz\nYou don't know how bad you trippin'\nYou went to that ho's house last night\nAnd you said that you didn't\nI seen your pic on Facebook\nThe skank bitch done tagged you in it!\"\n\n[Hopsin]\nI got put on with the beastie flow\nNow the sluts, they wanna bone when they see me, whoa!\nSo I must, I take 'em home, let the wee wee grow\nThen I bust from different strokes, like the TV show\nSee, when I be comin' through\nKickin' it raw, niggas like, \"Gee, he's dope!\"\nIf there's anyone throwing dirt at my name\nThen you know he be toast\nFor all of you rappers who bringin' me drama\nHomie, please be ghost\nThe only reason I'm bein' aggressive is 'cause we need hope\nYou might also like[Hopsin groupie (Hopsin)]\n\"Hey yo, Hopsin, I fuckin' love you\n'Cause you supply the best rhymes\nSince your flow is kinda strange\nYou should sign with Tech N9ne\nYou design erect lines, who am I to just lie?\nEvery single night I play your music right at bedtime\nAnd usually I'm not into dark dick\nI wanna do somethin' freaky enough to win your heart with\"\nI say, \"What you wanna do?\", she say, \"It's simple, Marcus\nI wanna blow it before you put it in like a Nintendo cartridge\"\n\n[Hopsin]\nBitch, I'm hotter than a UV ray\nHotter than the thought of Nicki Minaj naked\nMakin' her booty shake\nHot enough to pull up to yo' show and steal yo' groupie date\nHot enough to melt the ice cream that's on Gucci's face\nAnd now you havin' hot flashes\nAll the shit that you ever wanted in one MC, Hop has it\nDon't rap if you do not practice\nI cockblock wack shit, now get ready for Knock Madness!67Embed"

You ain't original\nYou were programmed to be you\nYou're a slave, and you don't even know it\nThe shit you think of, ain't even your thoughts\nLet's step out the box for a minute!\n\n[Verse 1]\nHow do we know if God exists? How do we know it's positive?\nAre you the definition of an angel or the opposite?\nIf you lost your wallet and I found it, I would not commit to stealin' it\nBut if the tables turned, then you would pocket it\nSee, I been me for so long, but I still don't know who Hopsin is\nHow come I'm the one my teachers used to have a problem with?\nI show my music to different labels, they ain't too fond of it\nBut in the underground I seem to get so many compliments\nSay my name and it's like people get afraid and shook\nBut if you take a look, you'll see I'm nothin' like an angry crook\nI'm learnin' hands-on, you busy with your face in books\nI'm here to benefit the world, so Heaven's where we're safely put\nI'm not a devil, not speakin' in tongues\nI just wanna touch your heart, I try to reach it in songs\nI'm from where a child's future's on the streets with the bums\nBecause it's hard to become somethin' so unique where I'm from\n[Chorus]\nWhen the sun's down\nNocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high\nIt may seem so that I can't see\nBut the darkness provides the light for me\nI don't wanna be lonely\nAnd the moon is my only homie\nIf there's a higher power, then show me\nInstead of nocturnal rainbows\n\n[Verse 2]\nObama's president, so? What's he represent?\nJust because the nigga's half black don't mean he's Heaven-sent\nYou're clueless to evidence and all the minds he's messin' with\nHis charmin' smile hasn't got my ass up out this debt for shit\nFrontin' like he's truly Jesus, and all you fools believe it\nThe change he's makin' isn't good, that's just how you conceived it\nIt's like we're all broker than ever, it's due to reasons\nDealin' with self-beneficial plans and the movement he's with\nIlluminati, or whatever the fuck they go by\nThey're the reason weird shit happens and we don't know why\nWhy did Michael Jackson start his tour, then have to go die?\nHow did rap music go from really good to so dry?\nReal artists get shelved and wack ones get famous\nTo leave masses brainless, a smart mind is dangerous\nIn their eyes; there probably ain't no real shit in your playlist\nYou're just a product of what the government has created\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWhen the sun's down\nNocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high\nIt may seem so that I can't see\nBut the darkness provides the light for me\nI don't wanna be lonely\nAnd the moon is my only homie\nIf there's a higher power then show me\nInstead of nocturnal rainbows\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, we're all smart, and we know what's bad and good for us\nBut yet, when you got offered some marijuana, you took a puff\nYour brain's a fuckin' powerhouse, but what, that wasn't good enough?\nIt's people like you who talk that \"shoulda, coulda, woulda\" stuff\nYou probably threw your life away \u2018cause you would rather get high\nWith no license or car, so you bum rides to get by\nSayin', \"I should've did this\" or \"I shouldn't have hung with this guy.\"\n\"I'm broke as fuck, my rent's high. Ah, I should've realized.\"\nI ain't bein' cruel with these situations that I address\nI more than likely could be someone you admire, yes\nBut it's because the blood, sweat and all the time that I invest\nWe play the same game, difference is you never try your best\nYou don't have a skill, you set yourself up for a higher mess\nI work around the clock, you slack off for lots of time to rest\nKeep bullshittin' till your life is gone\n\u2018Cause livin's naturally hell, you have to work to put a smile on\n[Chorus]\nWhen the sun's down\nNocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high\nIt may seem so that I can't see\nBut the darkness provides the light for me\nI don't wanna be lonely\nAnd the moon is my only homie\nIf there's a higher power then show me\nInstead of nocturnal rainbows\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the sun's down\nNocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high\nIt may seem so that I can't see\nBut the darkness provides the light for me\nI don't wanna be lonely\nAnd the moon is my only homie\nIf there's a higher power then show me\nInstead of nocturnal rainbows\n\n[Outro]\nNocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high\nNocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high\nNocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high\nNocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high65Embed"

The Dark Knight's in this bitch\nWithout the mask and cape, I'm actin' ape shit\nFaggot, embrace it, I just got validation\nOn my ass-whoopin' ticket; I'm that amazin'\nIt's my mad invasion of smashin' brains in\nMy fuckin' pen and pad was anxious\nAll these haters who mad and be naggin' at me\nI flip they ass off like an acrobat on a trapeze\nAnd I'll be lashin' back like a Shaq attack on these rap beats\nYou thought that I was done\nWith completely bein' an ass? Please!\nDon't think you raw just 'cause you got success\nI'll uppercut your ass so many times\nYou look like you was noddin' yes\nI'm the only child that my mom regrets\nProbly best that you don't buy my album\nSave your money, yo, do not invest\n[Chorus]\nYour bullshit, come off of that\nSomeone tell these motherfuckers that Hop is back!\nI got my du-rag on with my fitted sittin\u2019 on it\nNow I\u2019m ready to fuck the game up, nigga\nThey can get it (They can get it)\nYou can get it (You can get it)\nY'all can get it (It really doesn't matter, nigga)\n[Verse 2]\nI consider my flow a malignant rifle\nAnd strip survival, and have you screamin'\nLike R&B singers who hittin' high notes\nIt\u2019s sick and spiteful, 2Pac\u2019s twisted grim disciple\nI been this nice, yo, way before Michael had vitiligo\nMy ex girl's heart is so bruised and burned\nBeggin' me to quit rap\nBut I'm just not ready to let it loose for her\nAm I Hopsin or am I Lucifer?\nI didn't blow 'til I started talkin' a gang of shit\nTell me who you prefer\nNigga, you ain't ill in the booth\nI'd die and do my next show as a hologram\nAnd still be realer than you\nSee, I'm the shit, like I slithered in poo\nI'm sicker than stickin' my freakin' dick\nInside a bitch's syphilis cooch; it's Knock Madness\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nYour bullshit, come off of that\nSomeone tell these motherfuckers that Hop is back!\nI got my du-rag on with my fitted sittin\u2019 on it\nNow I\u2019m ready to fuck the game up, nigga\nThey can get it (They can get it)\nYou can get it (You can get it)\nY'all can get it (It really doesn't matter, nigga)\n[Verse 3]\nI got a problem, yo, I was ecstatic to buy Yeezus\nBut I burned it first, heard it, and snapped it in five pieces\nMan, Kanye on that bullshit\nThat\u2019s why the paparazzi made that nigga hit his fuckin' head, that\u2019s what that fool get\nYou think you God now\nYou half-assin' rap little faggot bitch?\nPerhaps you suffered brain damage\nBack when you had that accident\nBut most importantly, hip-hop isn\u2019t dead no more, you see\n'Cause Kendrick took the bar\nAnd then raised it up higher for MC's\nUnfortunately the little nigga's like 4 feet 3\nThe guy's a fuckin' midget, his high is still really short to me\nFuck givin' my pencil breaks\nMy mental state tells me to renovate\nIf you hand me your shit, I'll toss your demo tape\n\u201cHop, if you're not spreading love\nThen why do you even write music?\"\n'Cause this is how I feel\nWhen I ain\u2019t rappin' on the mic, you bitch!\nAm I supposed to coat it up? Am I not allowed to open up?\nI spill the blood of rappers\nAnd use Weezy dreads to soak it up\nBustin' like South Central driveby's\nSupport the guy with white eyes\nBut nigga, don\u2019t ride my dick when I\u2019m on that high rise\n[Chorus]\nYour bullshit, come off of that\nSomeone tell these motherfuckers that Hop is back!\nI got my du-rag on with my fitted sittin\u2019 on it\nNow I\u2019m ready to fuck the game up, nigga\nThey can get it (They can get it)\nYou can get it (You can get it)\nY'all can get it (It really doesn't matter, nigga)64Embed"

Who knows?\nThey convinced you that this shit was cool and hip to do\nSayin' it would lift your mood and make you feel invincible\nSo you started skippin' school\nHangin' with these wicked dudes\nUnaware that when you got older you played a bigger fool\nAnd it\u2019s pitiful, where the fuck they at now?\nIn they mid-20s passed out inside of a crack house\nBack when you met 'em I had doubts\nThey put you on the bad route, and when you needed they help to pick you up, they fuckin' backed out\nThey fuckin' got you, I can\u2019t lie, but now your brain's fried\nYou don\u2019t even act like you\u2019re the same guy\nYour momma told you that drugs are bad\nBut you ain\u2019t listen 'til the fire burned your ass\nNow you understand\nYou might also like[Hook]\nNow you always look like you don\u2019t know me\nAnd I\u2019m mad at the world\n'Cause the meth took away my homie\n(Give me back my homie, please come home!)\nI just wanna chill on the neighborhood block\nLike we used to (Where\u2019d you go?)\nI never woulda thought my best friend be gone in the future\nBut I was wrong\n\n[Verse 3]\nI ain\u2019t never felt this shit before, it gets me sore\nI reminisce on us playin' Nintendo 64\nAnd that Christmas in '97 we got new crispy boards\nAnd we was doin' ollies in my kitchen on the slippery floor\nShit changed and it happened quick, but I can\u2019t forget\nThat you was the first homie I started rappin' with\nYou could\u2019ve had half of this back when I had established it\nBut now I have to sit and feel bad\nLook at what your actions did!\nMan, you were so outgoin' and so hysterical\nSeein' you now is just unbearable, it\u2019s terrible\nYou should've made your choices wisely\nFuckin' with poison ivy; without your brain, please tell me, what would your point in life be?\nIt\u2019s a struggle to get your ass to listen\nReally hurt me and the rest of your family\nWith all your bad decisions\nWe always told you that drugs are bad\nBut you ain't listen 'til the fire burned your ass\nNow you understand\n[Hook]\nNow you always look like you don\u2019t know me\nAnd I\u2019m mad at the world\n'Cause the meth took away my homie\n(Give me back my homie, please come home!)\nI just wanna chill on the neighborhood block\nLike we used to (Where\u2019d you go?)\nI never woulda thought my best friend be gone in the future\nBut I was wrong\n\n[Outro]\nExcuse me, do you need a ride?\nLooks like you\u2019re goin' downtown\nYes, hop in my ride!\nWell, hi, I\u2019m Chris Dolmeth\nI\u2019m your best friend (Chris Dolmeth)\nI\u2019m all you need (Chris Dolmeth)\nIf you wanna succeed, hop in my ride\nWell, hi, I\u2019m Chris Dolmeth30Embed"

Hm, okay then\nAm I the only one that noticed humans on the same shit?\nY'all thoughts are sailin' on the same ship\nAnd if that's the case, then that's the reason that you ain't shit\nLet me enlighten you, my niggas, just let your brain drift\n\n[Verse 1]\nFirst of all, the best type of marketin'\nIs marketin' that doesn't feel like marketin'\nIt makes the people feel like they a part of it\nAnd when it's done right, corporations think it's marvelous\nThey feed us these ideas and they would place 'em in our hearts to sit\nIt's why players are good at gettin' chicks\nIt's why Nike is good at sellin' kicks\nIt's why Disney is loved by all the kids\nWhy McDonald's owners are super rich\nWe're too blinded to ever see 'em pitch\nSee, when this happens we take our health\nWealth, lives, and just hand 'em off\nThinkin' that we did this from organic thoughts\nI know you seen parents trick kids\nWith candy, toys, and Santa Claus\nThe same method is used to trap adults\nBut instead of candy, it's with money, religion, drugs, and alcohol\nMention that shit and it's gon' arouse us all\nI done seen niggas get into fights over cigarettes like a pack of dogs\nThey get you hooked and then they laugh at y'all\n[Chorus]\nI really hate to break it to you\nBut your life's bein' played with\nYou have not witnessed the world\n'Cause you stuck in the Matrix\nEverything we have been taught was all a lie\nOpen your eyes, open your mind, and fly\n\n[Verse 2]\nMan, can't you see we're robots\nWho know not what we do and we got no shot\nIn the real world until we climb out of this ice-cold box\nYour whole life has been part of a whole plot\nTo keep you at the bottom while they on top\nStay quiet, then they won't stop\nThey always tryna show us what we don't got\nThey do it to all of us 'til we finally break and go cop a gold watch\nKnowin' we need the cash for rent, my ass is sick\nJust thinkin' about how rich and powerful all these bastards get\nThey package ideas like it's oxygen\nThey make us feel like if we ain't got it we fucked and we cannot fit in\nThis fuckin' system is not your friend\nAnd understand they controllin' your thoughts 'cause they got a lot to win\nNiggas get turned away when I mention this\nIgnorance is bliss, but I don't give a fuck, I won't censor shit\nThe Matrix is real and you done entered it\nIt's way too intricate for you to ever realize it you fuckin' simpleton\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI really hate to break it to you\nBut your life's bein' played with\nYou have not witnessed the world\n'Cause you're stuck in the Matrix\nEverything we have been taught was all a lie\nOpen your eyes, open your mind, and fly\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, fuck Hollywood! Fuck all these reality shows!\nMakin' us feel lame unless we blowin' stacks on new clothes\nMakin' us feel like we ain't cool unless we have a few hoes\nMakin' us feel like we ugly unless we have a new nose\nI see naturally beautiful women get Botox, fake tits\nFake lips, they so brainwashed and it doesn't make sense\nFocus on your life and the path you pursuin'\n'Cause y'all too busy worried 'bout what Kim Kardashian's doin'\nCheck it, most of this shit that you sheep are watchin' on television\nIs fake as fuck and it's not real, I rebel against it\nIt's the Devil's business, they just reel y'all in\nIf they say it we do it, yo I'm tryna tell y'all, man\nThe system created the stereotype for the Black image\nThat's why my people are scared to be different\nWhy don't you get it? I'm done practicin' these ridiculous rituals\nIt's time I become a real individual and just do me\n[Chorus]\nI really hate to break it to you\nBut your life's bein' played with\nYou have not witnessed the world\n'Cause you're stuck in the Matrix\nEverything we have been taught was all a lie\nOpen your eyes, open your mind, and fly\n\n[Outro]\nUse your mind, be yourself\nDon't be nobody else but you\nYou and the meaning of life\nThere's no rules, no rules, no rules\nFly away! Fly away!\nAway, away, away!\nLife's too short not to live it\nThe world is all yours, come get it\nJust go and get it, it's beautiful84Embed"

    "plain": "\u201cIll Mind of Hopsin 9\u201d is dedicated to his son, Zade. It\u2019s about how he feels bad that his son has to live with his ex-girlfriend Alyce Madden, who resides in Australia. In the song, he expresses his emotions and thoughts about being cut off of his son\u2019s life. In September 2016, Hopsin had a trip to Australia where he was accused of beating up his girlfriend and then ended up on trial and was banned from the country for it. In a 2016 interview with Acton Entertainment, Hopsin talked about Australia and what happened:\n\nMe being banned from Australia is completely, just, a horrible thing. I\u2019ve dated many women in my lifetime and this is the only situation like this that has ever happened to me.\n\nOn June 14, 2017, Hopsin announced through an Instagram post that the 9th installment of his Ill Mind Saga would be featured on his album, No Shame.\n\nI got my album complete, most the videos shot for it and a crazy new \u201cIll Mind 9\u201d for you guys.\n\nEleven days prior to release of his new album, Hopsin went on social media to reveal that \u201cIll Mind 9\u201d would be released on November 23, 2017, a day before his highly anticipated album No Shame dropped. The music video for the track was released on November 23, 2017, and depicts his son, Zade, watching TV that features Hopsin rapping a song dedicated to him."

It\u2019s about how he feels bad that his son has to live with his ex-girlfriend Alyce Madden, who resides in Australia. In the song, he expresses his emotions and thoughts about being cut off of his son\u2019s life. In September 2016, Hopsin had a trip to Australia where he was accused of beating up his girlfriend and then ended up on trial and was banned from the country for it. In a 2016 interview with Acton Entertainment, Hopsin talked about Australia and what happened:\n\nMe being banned from Australia is completely, just, a horrible thing. I\u2019ve dated many women in my lifetime and this is the only situation like this that has ever happened to me.\n\nOn June 14, 2017, Hopsin announced through an Instagram post that the 9th installment of his Ill Mind Saga would be featured on his album, No Shame.\n\nI got my album complete, most the videos shot for it and a crazy new \u201cIll Mind 9\u201d for you guys.\n\nEleven days prior to release of his new album, Hopsin went on social media to reveal that \u201cIll Mind 9\u201d would be released on November 23, 2017, a day before his highly anticipated album No Shame dropped. The music video for the track was released on November 23, 2017, and depicts his son, Zade, watching TV that features Hopsin rapping a song dedicated to him."

Are you loving your existence?\nI wasn't at your birth, 'cause your mother made me miss it\nI tried to get a visa, I applied, and they denied it\n'Cause your momma told the police that I beat her, she was lyin'\nAnd now I'm banned for something bad that I ain't even do\nThere's a lot of land and water separating me and you\nYou're far away in Australia, and I am in America\nSo I cannot be there to do all of the things a parent does\nThis is my attempt at me raisin' you from a distance\nYou have Hopson in your blood, you are special, and you are gifted\nThe punishment your mother has given me doesn't seem fair\nJust know I love you, son, and I'm wishin' that I could be there\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up (it's sad)\nAnd now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)\nNope, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma\nNow sing it with me, son!\n\n[Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up (yeah, that's it)\nAnd that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma\n(That's why what?) (Hell no)\nNo, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nI know you and your momma stayin' with her parents Bill & Kirsten\nYou're partially black, I'm confident they're feelin' nervous\nThey don't like colored people, in their eyes you're still a burden\nThey assume you gonna grow up shootin' guns and stealin' purses\nBut that's not true, son, don't be sad\nI know you're not like that, you know I got your back\nListen, here's a funny joke that you could tell your grandmother\nShe looks like the Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters\nOh, I forgot, you're too young to know what that is\nBut that's the kinda thing I like to say to plumpy fat chicks\nThe humps on Mom's chest, they're not real, they're elastic\nAnd if you look closely, you can see she's made of plastic\nLike a toy, you my boy, my son, my friend\nI promise we gon' be together somehow in the end\nI am very ashamed that you don't have my last name\nEvery night I go to bed, and I'm feelin' this wicked pain, because\u2014\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up\nAnd now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)\nNope, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma\nYou know what time it is, son\n\n[Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up (that's right)\nAnd that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma\n(Daddy doesn't fuck with who?) (Hell no)\nNo, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma\n[Verse 3]\nCurrently my life has hit the floor\nI can't lie to you, shit is hard\nI should be buildin' with the Lord\nIt could be what I'm missin' or\nMaybe I should continue to hurt your momma and diss her more\nJust to relieve the tension that sits in my heart, 'cause it is sore\nWhen I'm spittin' bars about all my cash and exquisite cars\nThis was on my vision, and you were the one I did it for\nMy relationship with your momma is sittin' in the morgue\nAfter all this hell, I can't lie, I do wish she did abort\nOur lives are so unhappy\n'Cause this world is cold and nasty\nJust know your daddy don't condone havin' a broken family\nI'm so sad we couldn't work out our issues 'fore you arrived\nAnd now you have to suffer\n'Cause Mom and Daddy have stupid lives\nYou're way too young to notice it\nYou don't deserve to go through this\nIf I do see your mom again, this time I will assault the bitch\nAt least then I'll feel like my banning was justified\nLook at your momma, thank her for fuckin' up all our lives, and sing\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up\nAnd now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)\nNope, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma\nWhere's my choir at?\n\n[Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up (Momma had to fuck it all up)\nAnd that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma\n(Daddy doesn't fuck your momma) (Hell no)\nNo, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, son\nI'm sorry I can't be there with you\nBut I'll be there soon\nBut Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (no, no)\nNo, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma\nJust know that\u2014\n\n[Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up\nAnd that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma (hell no)\nNo, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma20Embed"

It's Knock Madness\nYeah, I'm back up in this, I'm a real nice nigga but I rap with vengeance\nOnly got bad intentions and I'm lookin' for a new mouth that my nutsack can fit in\nI look like an idiot to grab attention but my new fans tellin' me to trash my lenses\nIt's bad for business, I'm lackin' senses, feels like I'm trapped in a black dimension\nStepped in this bitch to wreck so don't disrespect\nI promise that it'd be a big regret\nI'll twist ya neck, I'm lookin' for a fish to catch\nI chop niggas up, yeah, I learned it from Tech\nI got hoes all over that wanna give me dome\nThey all yellin', \"Hopsin, you turn me on\"\nBut I feel like it's the Devil tryna get me, woah\nAnd I don't wanna do it, nigga, send me home\nNigga, I'm so cool (Cool), but I feel so low (Low)\nSee, I got a crew (Crew), but I feel solo\nI cruise (Cruise), but the wheels don't roll (Woah)\nYou feel what I'm sayin'? (Uh?) Shit, neither do I (Nah)\nI'mma give you niggas one more album then after that\nIt's peace out, man, I'm leavin' you guys, you know why?\n[Chorus]\nThe world made me feel like I lost myself\nMy own homies tellin' me that I need help\nIf you got a solution for me you should probably\nHoller at your boy if you know somebody\nLet me know, let me know, let me know, let me know (Yeah, yeah yeah)\nHoller at your boy if you know somebody\nLet me know, let me know, let me know, let me know (Yeah, yeah yeah)\nHoller at your boy if you know somebody\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no\n[Verse 2]\nHopsin is doomed, locked in a room, spaced out like a little pop of the shrooms\nGod lit a fuse, now I gotta make a decision and I don't really know which Hopsin to choose\nI'm a big wreck, did you not get the news? I made a million bucks but did not get abused\nHow did I manage to get robbed from the truth? Maybe I should've never went and dropped outta school\n\"It's not that bad, you're okay, kid, cheer up!\"\nBut I got a life that I ain't too sure of (Yup)\nSwagger lookin' just like Ace Ventura\nCan't look at myself, I might break this mirror (Shit! Fuck! Fuck!)\nI'm paranoid, I panic over every little scary noise\nSee, when I go to pick up the phone and tell friends about it\nThey won't answer 'cause they're annoyed\nI'm like \"Ugh...\"\nI put a porno on 'cause my life ain't awesome, man (Yeah, yeah)\nJack off, go to sleep, wake up, jack off again (Yeah, yeah)\nThen repeat the cycle\nCan't go to sleep unless I leave the lights on\nYou don't know how many fuckin' demons I know\nMaybe I should go and try to read the Bible (Fuck! Oh no!)\nI don't even like rap, only thing I wanted was just to be cool (Be cool)\nAnd hang out with a group of friends and solve mysteries like I'm Scooby-Doo (-By Doo)\nBut I got way more than I bargained for\nYou can't kill when your heart is sore\nI'm so mad I could start a war\nSo fuck Hopsin, man, I don't even know who I are no more\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI feel like I lost myself\nMy own homies tellin' me that I need help\nIf ya got a solution for me you should probably\nHoller at your boy if you know somebody\nLet me know, let me know, let me know, let me know (Yeah, yeah yeah)\nHoller at your boy if you know somebody\nLet me know, let me know, let me know, let me know (Yeah, yeah yeah)\nHoller at your boy if you know somebody\n\n[Verse 3]\nMan, y'all niggas tryin' to kill my vibe, lately don't nobody feel my rhymes\nDizzy blowin' up, tryin' to steal my shine, I'm all outta ammo, my skills just died\nBut, \"Oh my God, I love 'Ill Mind 5'! The one where the dumb skippity bums get high\nThat there changed my whole entire life, you make more tings like that, I'll buy!\"\nWell, I got news for you, my screws are loose, I'll tell ya\nThis rap thing here's what I used to do, now I'm movin' to Australia\nWhen I go ghost, I'mma get a house on the Gold Coast, yellin' \"YOLO\" on a couch, feelin' so dope\nLivin' low pro so these foul niggas don't know, I'll be struttin' around like \"hell yeah\"\nMan, I'm losin' my mind, but y'all assume that I'm cool when I rhyme\nSee, I'm tryin' to be Marcus and Hopsin but I get depressed when the two intertwine\nTruthfully, I'm not the man that I used to be\nNobody cares so I use the beats\nTo talk to so I lose the heat\nI'm cut bad and the bruise is deep, is there anything you can do for me?\n[Chorus]\nThe world made me feel like I lost myself\nMy own homies tellin' me that I need help\nIf ya got a solution for me you should probably\nHoller at your boy if you know somebody\nLet me know, let me know, let me know, let me know (Yeah, yeah yeah)\nHoller at your boy if you know somebody\nLet me know, let me know, let me know, let me know (Yeah, yeah yeah)\nHoller at your boy if you know somebody\n\n[Outro]\nHoller at your boy if you know somebody\nHoller at your boy if you know somebody\nHoller at your boy if you know somebody\nHoller at your boy if you know somebody63Embed"

You nailed it!\n'Cause you didn't promote my record\nAnd I don't know who the hell did\nYou shoulda hired Tanner Guinn, yup, Hop is mad again\nJust enough to leave your little skull frame hammered in\nSee, this is what happens when I take that little magic pen\nAnd get to scribblin' psychotic lines worth some damagin'\nI hate to tell you, but you are crazy\nYou were born as a retard baby\nAnd when I come around, you start shaking\n'Cause you're a bitch who dates hard ladies\nWith big beards who say, \"Arr, matey!\"\nYo, Pillow Man the alias Hopsin has been the signature\nI'm far from similar to you niggas whose flow is miniature\nYou'll be diminished for crossin' limits on my perimeter\nI'm not a gimmick, I'm a committed, demented, sinister\nIt's Funk Volume, now what?\nIf you thinkin' that rap's officially dead, you haven't found us\nWe built the movement from the ground up, your sound sucks\nUntil now we let you slide, but you're now fucked\nIt's just reality, you posers done been wack\nI hold it down like my boner in gym class\nAnd fuck Wayne! Man, I'm doper than his ass\nHim, Nicki, and Drake can get thrown over a cliff fast\nYou got cash? Big whoop-dee-fuckin'-doo!\nIf I had a knife right now, it would be stuck in you\nYo, you ain't gonna like this corner that you pushed me up into\n'Cause all you rap about's how you beat the pussy up and ooze\nFuck your fast car, your cheap singin'\nYou keep sayin' the same shit, while T-Painin'\nAnd we bangin' simply because it's all we hear\nMan, look at all these queers\nThe shit is so watered-down I developed soggy ears\nKill me! Shit, I'm waitin' to die, bitches\nI hate on all you rappers who made it, 'cause I didn't\nAnd I admit it, man, I ain't gon' bullshit y'all\nAs long as you walkin' away sayin' that fool spits raw\nYo, I'm from the West, I throw up the W and I stay hot\nBut still ain't mentioned\nWith Nipsey Hu$$le, Glasses, or Jay Rock\nWhat I gotta do, dig 'Pac up out of his grave spot\nAnd wear his face as a mask to my next show to create props?\nPeople always ask why do I sound mad\n'Cause I ain't got a girlfriend with a round ass\nAnd all my fuckin' dinners come in a brown bag\nHow sad! I need a crossroad to get found at\nMost rappers be in a six-four\nI prefer a big horse, lit torch, and a pitchfork\nWhile you out late workin' your shift when the kids snore\nI'm fuckin' your wife while the bitch snorts\nWearin' swim shorts\nI got a message on Facebook from some lame guy\nAnd he was like, \"Hopsin, dude! I fucking HATE life!\nI wanna rap, but I have stage fright, and I can barely write\nAnd I never make music that the babes like!\nAnd when I come home from school, I wait 'til late night\nAnd bump your music really super-loud\nAnd paint my face white\nFor real, bro, if you just help me, dude\nI swear to God, I'll do anything you tell me to!\"\nWhoa, don't hit me up tryna suck my dick!\n'Cause I'm a guy, and I would rather fuck five chicks\nWith some plump nice tits and the butt size thick\nSo I can hit the G-spot that only tough guys hit\nSo if you hear a rumor that I rape mics, it's true\nWhen I drop RAW, that will be the day I get sued\nDamon Elliot, I might as well just say bye to you\nFuck the industry! Go out and get Haywire too!\n[Outro]\nShitYou might also like14Embed"

(Who?)\nSo don't underestimate me, I do this, truest\nI'm calm and ill but still drop bombs, I kill\nYou know the deal, with my godly skills\nYou wanna jog the field in my shoes? There's a lot to fill\nIt won't happen, you cannot be real\nMan, there's so many rappers that wanna catch my fade\nSo many bitches that wanna snatch my brain\nI'll probably end up on the news, dead, bullet in the head\nMama in the street yellin': \"That's my baby!\"\nYou want me to keep it to a minimal with the syllables?\nI think you should get up off my genitals\nEvery nigga identical when they spit a flow, this shit is critical\nI'ma have to get rough and get all my sentinels\nNigga, what you be sippin' on? I'm guessin' your pen is broke\nIs it difficult for you to get better? You're so despicable\n'Cause your shit is boo-boo, your bars are predictable\nI do not bump it, it's hard to get into you\nPlease admit it, man, the voyage is radical\nMind is set to just destroy, I'm an animal\nKillin' shit, man, I'm a poisonous antidote\nI be on it, man, your boy's international\nYeah, I'm mad with rhymes\nBeen doin' this since '99, I'm a mastermind\nHomie, it's 2015, and all my niggas gon' kill it\nWhen they finish the job, the other half is mine\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFool, you ain't on that real shit\nI live here, you on a field trip\nI'm made of shit you ain't built with\nYou a bitch, yo' girl need a real dick\nIt's no doubt niggas gon' feel this\nYou don't scare niggas, not even a little bit\nI serve you, you get the bill quick\nCrown me, I'm a real prince\n\n[Chorus]\nGive me that crown boy! (Give it!)\nI said \"Give me that shit!\"\nGive me that crown boy! (C'mon!)\nI said \"Give me that shit!\"\nGive me that crown boy! (Give it!)\nI said \"Give me that shit!\"\nGive me that crown boy! (C'mon!)\nGive me that shit!\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe rap game's mine, I revolve it round me\nI think I have lost it, and my mind's exhausted\nI'm nauseous from the process\nOf hoppin' on stage and tryin' to dive in moshpits\nNigga, why you focused on diamonds?\nThese Cubic Zirconia's all up in my ear\nOver jewelry, I don't get excited\nMy perception in life is \"Why the fuck am I here, nigga?\"\nI've been this way since your ass has been suckin' on titties\nSince niggas cocked back and start bustin' on 50\nSince J-Lo was mobbin' in public with Diddy\nSince Biggie and Pac got shot up, it's a pity\nThat bullshit you're talkin', I'm not in the mood, bro\nContinue yappin', you'll see Hopsin is brutal\nKeep pushin' me, you gon' get dropped with some Judo\nYou fannin' out like you want cock in yo' culo\nNiggas only in it for money and bitches\nI don't even think they wanna rap no more\nBut they wanna be all over the television\nRockin' feminine shit, tryin' to act homo\nOld bi-ass niggas can't bypass niggas\n\"I can't change even if I tried\"-ass niggas\nTight jeans on so they show yo' ass-ass niggas\nIn the pool with the homie, tryin' to splash-ass niggas\nFruity as Mike and Ike, you'll get diced to rice\nWhen I arrive I pull up like \"Hi! Surprise!\"\nIt might be wise to hide when the nightly skies are high\nFuckin' with an ape; no Life of Pi\nTell me, what position would the game be in\nWithout me havin' the ability to rape the pen?\nPound Syndrome, this is it, I'm weighin' in\nI still hate y'all niggas and I can't pretend\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nFool, you ain't on that real shit\nI live here, you on a field trip\nI'm made of shit you ain't built with\nYou a bitch, yo' girl need a real dick\nIt's no doubt niggas gon' feel this\nYou don't scare niggas, not even a little bit\nI serve you, you get the bill quick\nCrown me, I'm a real prince\n\n[Chorus]\nGive me that crown boy! (Give it!)\nI said \"Give me that shit!\"\nGive me that crown boy! (C'mon!)\nI said \"Give me that shit!\"\nGive me that crown boy! (Give it!)\nI said \"Give me that shit!\"\nGive me that crown boy! (C'mon!)\nGive me that shit!108Embed"

Yo.\n\n[Verse]\nIn high school, Marcus wasn't a helpful student\nHe dropped out 'cause teachers would never help him through it\nAnd if I don't save this rap game who else would do it?\nThis is my motherfucking world, welcome to it\nIf you thinking that Hop's whack, then you is hating\nAnd what the fuck do my contacts have to do with Satan?\nI want a bitch with a bomb ass and some lubrication\nA loverboy, you see I'm that but I'm rude and blatant\nNow you listen here: I started a movement this year\nI will fuck you up if you interfere\nYou been a queer your whole fucking life and I'll kick you into gear\nYou trying to prove you a lunatic? Ooh, I'm oozing in fear!\nYou on some sloppy-clown bitch shit: I'll rip your head off\nPoke a stick through it, then beat the rest of your body down with it\nI start violence, cops come with the loud sirens\nNow I have to hop a barbed wire fence\nThey find me in the broke down car I had been hiding in\nHomicide is now the charge I'm against\nWalk up to the jail cell with the guard I am with\nHe pushes me in and then the bar slide and sit\nThis new age of rappers, all they wanna do is floss, why?\nSwearing they're the boss guy, thinking that they're all fly\nYou, Lil' Wayne, Soulja Boy, this Asher Roth guy\nNormally I would mind, but this time I've lost mine\nWho the hell is he? The biggest hater that you'll ever meet\nWhite contacts, so you motherfuckers remember me\nLyrics put together so cleverly, you will never be\nOn my level, I chop all of you rappers to celery\nFake thugs rap like: \"I'll let the Glock spit at you\nJust got out the pen 'cause I move how real niggas move\"\nNo, don't lie, 'cause it hurts when you hear the truth\nYou got out the pen and wrote a verse with it, didn't you?\nFuck life, you can't tell me nothing\nI'll shove a knife in your back and leave it poking out through your belly-button\nSir, your daughter wasn't that reluctant\nYou see this 8-inch dick bulging out of my pants? Well, she sucked it\nI went to Wal-Mart with a Visa card, bought your wife a leotard\nAnd made her try it on to get my penis hard\nI'm pissed enough, I can never find a bitch to fuck\nI beat my dick a lot, that's why only my right wrist is buff\nI go dumb off of two packs of Now and Laters\nThen fight niggas like I was the black Power Ranger\nHead to the lake then wrestle a couple alligators\nThen run through the woods butt-naked; so what, pal? It's nature\nWhy the fuck would I collab witchu?\nYeah, you're good friends with Marcus but Hopsin don't wanna rap witchu!\nYou're full of shit like some ass-tissue\nAnd you're a bitch when you go to studios you bring your dad with you\nNo! Unacceptable, now watch me wreck a flow\nNiggas be hating 'cause I'm balling just like my testicles\nWord is bond, the way I'm on this mic and serving bombs\nI might as well have an Osama bin Laden turban on\n[Outro]\nFuck, yes\nYes, fuck yes, fuck yes\nFuck yes, man, I'm outYou might also like21Embed"

Are you only in my dreams?\nOnly when the moon is shining\nThat's when you are beside me\nGirl, I need you\nAnd that's real\nI don't wanna wake up\nI'll stay asleep (You know baby)\nYour love is all I need\nI'm really hoping I find you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI wake up in the morning with this sensational pain\nIt goes straight to the brain then my day is invaded with rain\nEngraved in my veins is your name, this ain't gonna change\nIt is staying remain unless my heart is deflated and drained\nYour love is magic\nDaydreaming about you is such a habit\nThought I saw you when I was driving\nBut I was stuck in traffic\nIf other girls flirt they're sadly mistaken\nI tell em' scram cause they need to know I'm happily taken\nYou see my love life, it wasn't going well till I found you\nFellas get jealous and doubtful when I tell em' about you\nI know we had our fair share in the past, with selfish lust\nBut once we came together we sealed it and nailed it shut\nYour touch is that of a goddess\nWhen we kiss, I'm at a lack of words\nEspecially when we pull away\nAnd then you smile afterwards\nIn our hearts, we're no different in color\nWe live for each other, I'm glad you're my significant other\nI love you\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWhere are you? Are you only in my dreams?\nOnly when the moon is shining\nThat's when you are beside me\nGirl, I need you\nAnd that's real\nI don't wanna wake up\nI'll stay asleep (You know baby)\nYour love is all I need\nI'm really hoping I find you\n\n[Verse 3]\nBaby it saddens me to know that you only exist in dreams\nI sit and fiend for you when I'm awake\nAnd it seems like I\u2019ll never be happy unless I sleep\nI failed to see the point in living without you\nIt got me thinking death is sweet\nI\u2019ll never know unless I leap, I guess I reach for the stars\nCause girl I'm in love with you oh so desperately\nWhat I'm about to do I kept discrete\nI rest the cheek on the pillow as I'm counting sheep\nTake me to ecstasy\nI tried to get you out my head, the pain's a lot worse\nI love you more than anything, I won\u2019t even put God first\nYou\u2019re the only reason that I sleep so often\nI'm hurting nights I don\u2019t see you\nI just keep on tossing and turning\nI feel so lost and deserted, you made my life good\nI told you if I had to take a bullet for you, I would\nSo baby here I go with the proof, this is it\nThe moment of truth, only for you *gunshot*\n[Bridge]\nWhere are you? Are you only in my dreams?\nI don\u2019t wanna wake up\nI\u2019ll stay asleep (You know baby)\nYour love is all I need\nI\u2019m really hoping to find you\n\n[Outro]\nI don\u2019t wanna wake up\nI don\u2019t wanna, don\u2019t wanna wake up\nI don\u2019t wanna wake up I\u2019ll stay asleep\nI don\u2019t wanna wake up\nI don\u2019t wanna, don\u2019t wanna wake up\nI don\u2019t wanna wake up I\u2019ll stay asleep42Embed"

So I'ma flop? Nah, that's where you guys are wrong\nI shit on niggas, that's why I rap with a diaper on\nDon't be approaching me with none of your mess\nTalking 'bout where I belong\nJust tell your friends all about me and sit\nAnd watch as they minds get blown\nNiggas on that basic shit, now I'ma go ape a bit\nI know y'all prayed for this, so don't trip\nHere's a handkerchief for your razored wrist\nMy flow got a few ways to switch\nNiggas act hard, I'ma change the script\nEverybody begging to be a buddy of mine\n'Cause they know I got skills y'all can't prevent\nWhen I lace a hit you impressive, none\nYou can take it as a lesson, son\nIf you was smart, you'd drop the mic and\nTry to stick up a bank with a weapon drawn\nPillow Man was slept upon\nThat's the reason the West was gone\nBut I set the bomb, when it blows up\nYou niggas will know where the heck I'm from\nI'm keeping it raw fo' sho', flow so diabolical\nYou all should know that it took like 10 whole years\nJust for my balls to grow\nNo overnight success, I'm struggling just to write this mess\nThe road to righteousness was more than words and skill that I possess\n[Chorus: Hopsin & SwizZz]\nI was the nigga all you niggas used to clown\nNow when I come around, I got you motherfuckers like \"Wow!\"\nYeah, how you like me now?\nI'm flossin' all you nigga's like BLAOW!\nAyo! How you like me now, motherfucker?\nHow you like me..\nYo! How you like me now, motherfucker?\nHow you like me..\nAyo! Let me see you clown, motherfuckers\nLet me see..\n(Yeah!) How you like me now, motherfuckers (Guess who it is!)\nHow you like me...\n\n[Verse 2: SwizZz]\nAyo! S-W-I-Z-Z and add another\nMy swagger makes your girl want to cut, like upper\nI'm mad hot, dog, my 16s should come with mustard\nIf you think I have a big head, then you haven't see my brother!\nStacked bad niggas swore I wouldn't make it rappin'\nPromised it couldn't happen and hated with a passion\nA mixtape later I silenced their laughing\nNow the same ones would probably suck my dick if I asked 'em\nIt's obvious I have it locked like CAPS\nRocking to a bitch fight beat that slaps\nI do it major, Poly Sci & Bio\nI don't have haters only fans in denial\nNow gimme a minute to hop in my zone, I'm making 'em pop like Mary\nI'm rocking the party to act all retarded, I'm making 'em pop like cherries\nI know this nigga is wild, but I will knock him down\nJust answer this question for me:\nHow you like me, how you like me now?\nYou might also like[Chorus: Hopsin]\nI was the nigga all you niggas used to clown\nNow when I come around, I got you motherfuckers like \"Wow!\"\nYeah, how you like me now?\nI'm flossin' all you nigga's like BLAOW!\nAyo! How you like me now, motherfucker?\nHow you like me..\nYo! How you like me now, motherfucker?\nHow you like me..\nAyo! Let me see you clown, motherfuckers\nLet me see..\nYeah! How you like me now, motherfuckers\nHow you like me...\n\n[Verse 3: Hopsin]\nOh, so you wanna be cool? You wanna be pals?\nYou wanna be closest friends?\nSee a nigga so hot, that's why I'm popping up\nLike I'm toaster bread\nI say shit that don't get said\nThat's why I can't roll with feds\nIlluminati got they eye on me\nAnd they gon' see to it that a nigga don't get fed\nMy purpose ain't hard to see\nI pull up on rappers like \"pardon me\nYour bars are weak, you put too much time\nTryna get your sparkling charm to bling\"\nI be kickin' 'em multiple syllables\nRipping up shows and holding my genitals\nGet a dose of the wicked flow before your niggas run up\nSaying \"Homie, you should've known\"\nIt's crazy how life can switch\nI ain't gonna lie to you mine was shit\nNot anymore, shit changed up\nFrom woman selection to size of tits\nI know bitches who can ride the dick\nNiggas who think that my eyes are sick\nShowing 'em many agents who be loving\nThe melodies that I supply them with\nYo! I gotta a note for all y'all\nIn the rap game who got an album stacking dough\nY'all got big, chains'll start falling off like Michael Jackson's nose\nWho the illest? Y'all know\nHopsin, yeah, bravo\nI'm 'bout to leave the building right now\nAbadeAbade that's all folks\n[Chorus: Hopsin]\nI was the nigga all you niggas used to clown\nNow when I come around, I got you motherfuckers like \"Wow!\"\nYeah, how you like me now?\nI'm flossin' all you nigga's like BLAOW!\nAyo!

I'm rude, rugged and love to intrude ruckus\nToo stubborn, I got the motherfuckin' juice chuggin'\nYou think you runnin' shit but you really my cute puppet\nJust danglin' from a string, I was made to disrupt the peace\nDon't care if you poppin', bitch, you basic as fuck to me\nI've been labeled a fuckin' beast, it's a fatal corrupt disease\nDon't be callin' tryna sit for a bagel and cup of tea, my nigga\n[Hook]\nOoh, you don't want the backlash\nWhy you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!\nFuck around and break you all proper\nYou gon' need to see the fuckin' witch doctor (Sangoma)\nNigga, peep game, no shame, I won't ever change\nYou don't want the backlash\nWhy you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!\nSavage!\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm the dirty scoundrel, livin' life on the down-low\nI've been to Hell, I sat with the man of the household\nMy heart froze, but you don't wanna know how cold\nI feel like the one, but I ain't what you should count on\nBuckle up, nigga! Have a blast, I'm an avalanche\nMashin' fans down on your master plan with a planned attack\nIt's like a massive pack of elephants, charge you with cataracts\nSo call an ambulance, I'm the straw that just broke the camel's back\nYou don't want problems, I'm serious, I am too sick (Yeah, yeah)\nI promise I ain't delirious, I can prove it (Yeah, yeah)\nThink twice, nigga, I'm eerie as Tyson's toothpick\nUndercover Prodigy, visualize the movement, nigga\nThis is a brand new side of me that's emergin'\nEvil and purgin', I am more deceivin' in person\nScreamin' and cursin', fuck the world with penis insertions\nI'ma feel this way until the day I'm leavin' this Earth, man\nYou might also like[Hook]\nOoh, you don't want the backlash\nWhy you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!\nFuck around and break you all proper\nYou gon' need to see the fuckin' witch doctor (Sangoma)\nNigga, peep game, no shame, I won't ever change\nYou don't want the backlash\nWhy you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!\nSavage!\n\n[Bridge]\nSoek jy \u2018n sangoma? Soek jy \u2018n sangoma? A sangoma?\nI can show you the way if you want to know\nWitch doctor, witch doctor\nSoek jy \u2018n sangoma? Soek jy \u2018n sangoma? A sangoma?\nSomebody better call the witch doctor (Witch doctor)\nWi-wi-wi-wi-witch doctor!\n\n[Verse 3]\nListen, I ain't gon' pretend to be the best\nI don't give a fuck about ever bein' politically correct\nLook at the fans that all my misery has blessed\nAs long as I'm breathin' I ain't gon' give emcees a rest\nMusic can make a struggle seem cool \u2014 it's not\nDo you know what the fuck I've been through? A lot\nThere is an evil me that speaks to me every evening\nI tried to get rid of him but he rules my thoughts\n[Hook]\nOoh, you don't want the backlash\nWhy you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!\nFuck around and break you all proper\nYou gon' need to see the fuckin' witch doctor (Sangoma)\nNigga, peep game, no shame, I won't ever change\nYou don't want the backlash\nWhy you actin' like a badass?

Yes\nI'm on one, that's why my homies left\nI live with no regrets, motherfuckers I won't repent\nMan, the other day I cussed my girlfriend's parents out\nIt is apparent now\nThey tryna justify their daughters bullshit?\nWhelp, I am raw enough to air it out\nI'm intense at times, in my mind\nThere's a grinch inside that tells me to write offensive lines\nThe shit I do doesn't make sense in your head\nNigga fuck you 'cause it makes sense in mine\nYeah, I think I got a little ego\nIf you cut me open, you would see I'm full of it\nFrom the 818, a motherfuckin' Panorama City hooligan\nI see the whole world and everybody looking like a duplicate (that's true)\nBitch I do me, and that's the only way you'll ever see me doin' it\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus: Hopsin & Matt Black]\nI debate\nShould I smile like everything's good and pretend that life is great\nOr should I let the world see the real me and not hide this pain\nI tried to be like the rest of y'all, sorry I just can't\nI'ma probably die this way (I'ma die this way)\n\n[Chorus: Matt Black]\nAh yeah, ah yeah\nAh yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way\nAh yeah, ah yeah\nAh yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way\n[Bridge: Joey Tee]\nI don't feel no shame\nWhy should I hide this pain?\nI'm sorry\nI'm sorry\nSorry we're not the same\n\n[Verse 3: Hopsin]\nThere isn't much that anybody else can tell me\nI'm the only nigga living in my shoes and this shit is overwhelming\nI travel earth like a lost soul\nFires burning as I rot slow\nThere ain't many I can vent to in this world\nI got family but we're not close\nSo I tell my story through a hot song\nYou all know to get your popcorn\nWhen I hit you with the Ill Mind\nNeverland? That's a place you know we're not goin'\nThis is struggle and pain\nAbout me always being stuck in the rain\nTo be honest, I don't want it to change\nI'ma take it to my death bed up until nothing remains\n[Chorus: Matt Black]\nAh yeah, ah yeah\nAh yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way\nAh yeah, ah yeah\nAh yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way\nAh yeah, ah yeah\nAh yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way\nAh yeah, ah yeah\nAh yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way16Embed"

    "plain": "Earlier Hopsin had his own issues with his ex wife that all of us fans heard about on No Shame Album. So later after that album Hopsin released Hells Carol and Lowkey singles where many of us thought he finally got over what he was going through. But it turned out to be not because he released I Dont Want It single and took a break from music to find himself in Thai. He released Covid Mansion and later on announced on IG that Kumbaya will be a \u201c Sag my Pants \u201d type. Which is the persona of Hopsin that most of his fanbase really love the most. To sum up, I personally believe that Hopsin finally found himself and picked his torn pieces together to finally tease that an album is in the baking in the end of the song."

       "plain": "Earlier Hopsin had his own issues with his ex wife that all of us fans heard about on No Shame Album. So later after that album Hopsin released Hells Carol and Lowkey singles where many of us thought he finally got over what he was going through. But it turned out to be not because he released I Dont Want It single and took a break from music to find himself in Thai. He released Covid Mansion and later on announced on IG that Kumbaya will be a \u201c Sag my Pants \u201d type. Which is the persona of Hopsin that most of his fanbase really love the most. To sum up, I personally believe that Hopsin finally found himself and picked his torn pieces together to finally tease that an album is in the baking in the end of the song."

Come visit my shed\nI live on the edge, let's jump, shit, I'll go first\nMmm, yikes, quite preposterous (Yeah)\nWhite kids soaking up the hype up off it\nHi, I'm Hopsin, I'm obnoxious\nI've been token like the guy from Boston\nWatch me rise to top ten (Yeah)\nYou know what I mean? Ain't no one like me\nI'ma turn all of my haters to some overnight fiends\nI done made a lot of money from exposin' my grief (What?)\nFlow catch bodies like it's COVID-19, nigga\nBitch, listen, I'm exertin' the gas fumes\nI'm the asshole who goes to work in a bad mood (Yeah)\nMe and my alter ego make a murderous rap group (Uh)\nI'm handin' beef to niggas like I'm servin' up fast food (Yeah)\nI should've been spazzed, now the burden has passed through\nHaters wanna laugh at all the hurdles I ran through\nBut the word on the avenue (What?)\nIs now they wanna watch UP\nLike a fuckin' pervert in the bathroom\nNigga, ew, yuck (Yuh)\nThe ladies always tell me I'm a real cunt (Yuh)\nThese wack motherfuckers, that's a meal lunch (Yeah)\nOn every instrumental, I'ma spill guts\nAnd I'm still nuts (Hello)\nLike RoboCop's scrotum\nI'm givin' niggas Hell but I really hope I'm not goin'\nAnd if I do, I'm pullin' up with hoes in my foreign\nWhile the Man above is watchin' with his Coke and popcorn\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWell I guess I'm a villain, labeled as strange\nLabeled a clown, labeled deranged\nLabeled as someone you might put to shame\nLabeled a freak, who's unable to change\nI'm sick in the head, I'm sick with the grind\nI am not someone you casually find\nWhere is the light?

Niggas better duck and run for cover like it's fuckin' Iraq\n(Stand down, nigga!)\nI'm pouring liquor for your ass, you ain't even die yet (Oh no!)\nI've been headin' up the ladder long enough\nIt's time I hit the climax (Yikes!)\nYour career's goin' bye-bye, it's ironic you don't got a bypass\nNiggas know that I've been ill\nMan, the whole time that I've been here\nI done made a fortune like ten mil'\nFrom the paper lines that my pen fills\nAnd if I don't spend it, my kids will\nI'm low-key but a big deal\nHoes see me and they freeze up, that's why they all on my dick still\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThey tell me I'm too hostile, I am Picasso\nBitches like, \"Remember me from high school?\" Nah, ho\nCame up in this shit killin' niggas with the hot flow\nY'all ain't got a fuckin' thing on Hop, whoa\n\n[Chorus]\nBoy, you better rock slow\nWho am I? I'm Picasso\nTake the high road\nASAP 'cause I ain't liable\nFor no nigga (Nope!)\nMy fuckin' head is in the cosmos\nGot it locked though\nBitch, I'm Pablo Picasso (Mhm)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've been told the new game plan's\nTo make bullshit for the new age fans\nAnd you can't pop unless you take Xans\nAnd flex on the 'Gram like you do make bands\nWhat? Oh no, they like, \"Fuck boom bap rap, you can't win\"\n\"Save that shit for the Wu-Tang Clan\"\nThat's when I bust in like the Kool-Aid Man (Yeah!)\nLook, I ain't the nigga who pullin' up\nTryna get shine by how much the Rollie glow (Nah)\nI'm here to rain on parades\nMy sinister ways to fuck up the rodeo (Woo!)\nI do my shows and hoes\nBe losin' control like I was the Holy Ghost (Stop!)\nWhen I deliver the penis it lies in the mouth, she call it Pinocchio\nMmm, man, who want war with me?\nBitch, I torture beats, I've been born to beast\nStill I abort MC's, oh so horribly\nDog, your corpse'll be right on the floor with these\nFeet that I'll stomp you out with\nThis my house, bitch, and you can't afford the lease (Watch out!)\n(Whoa) Fuck all that Hollywood shit\nOver half of you not even lit that be ridin' my dick\nI got no problem with this\nI come through and your body is zipped, I could hardly resist\nNigga, my hobby is pissin' on anyone I can offend\nI got no friends\nWhoever thinkin' they hot, go and tell 'em nobody's convinced, hmm\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nThey tell me I'm too hostile, I am Picasso\nBitches like, \"Remember me from high school?\" Nah, ho\nCame up in this shit killin' niggas with the hot flow\nY'all ain't got a fuckin' thing on Hop, whoa\n\n[Chorus]\nBoy, you better rock slow\nWho am I? I'm Picasso\nTake the high road\nASAP 'cause I ain't liable\nFor no nigga (Nope!)\nMy fuckin' head is in the cosmos\nGot it locked though\nBitch, I'm Pablo Picasso\nRock slow\nWho am I? I'm Picasso\nTake the high road\nASAP 'cause I ain't liable\nFor no nigga (Nope!)\nMy fuckin' head is in the cosmos\nGot it locked though\nBitch, I'm Pablo Picasso (Mhm)26Embed"

   "lyrics": "Good Guys Left Behind Lyrics[Intro]\nI know I don't usually make love songs, but there's a few\nSpecial girls who kind of changed my perspective on everything\nAnd I feel like every guy comes to that point in his life\nWhere he changes from a boy into a man\nSo yo, this one is strictly for the ladies, only\n\n[Verse 1]\nSee when I met your stupid ass up at the mall on accident\nI thought you was the baddest chick I ever seen but that was so inaccurate\nYou stole my heart like you had done some magic trick\nYour essence was so fabulous you also had a sexy look and rack of tits\nI only had intentions to respect your ass and that was it\nI took you for a walk under the moon, we joked and laughed a bit\nThe chemistry was there, right where we met I had to act on it\nAt that moment I knew you was the girlfriend that I had to get\nWhat happened bitch? I swear you had me mad sprung\nOur first time hanging I could've did more than I had done\nBut I didn't because I was nervous, in my heart, you had reserved a place\nSo sexing you just wasn't on my mind cause you were worth the wait\nShit got to a point where you started cancelling dates we made\nGave me crazy rage, you had me thinking you hate me, great\nYou vanished with no signs and I didn't even know why\n'Til I found out you had a fucking boyfriend this whole time\n[Bridge]\nWhy couldn't you just tell me?\nYou had me buying plane tickets to go see your stupid ass\nThen you cancelled on me at the last minute talking about you busy\nBitch, I'm busier than you and I still make time for your bitch ass\nFuck you!\n\n[Hook]\nI should've fucked you when I had the chance to (the chance to)\nNow I'm sittin' alone in my house and I'm wishin' you'd call me right now\nBaby, perhaps I should have been less nicer than I was to you\nCause this seems like all the good girls go for bad guys\nAnd good guys get left behind\n\n[Verse 2]\nI swear I'm sick of this, bein' stuck in predicaments\nGettin' the shitty end of the stick and it's never different\nHours spent on the phone as I'm listenin' to your gibberish\nBlah-blah-blah your mind was scrambled I tried to configure it\nI'm not one you should move past, these player guys, you choose that\nTo me, you're worth a lot more than what they had valued you as\nOnly reason they hollered was because you got a cute ass\nThey just want you for sex and then they move on to a new task\nYour actions show your true class, I think you're moving too fast\nDatin' these strangers can be dangerous, they rarely do last\nBut you just too blinded to see, just like a disease\nThe guy that you been lookin' for is more than likely me\nBut now I'm on some \"fuck you\" type shit\nYour mind is so indecisive, bitch, cry\nI'll no longer be ya tissue you can wipe with\nYou just triflin', you get screwed so much\nI'm thinkin' that you like it, my prediction on\nYour future is always right, I must be psychic, damn\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nSee, I ain't even tryna affiliate myself with stupid\nPeople like you anymore, it's the same damn story with\nYou every single time, don't be callin' me talkin 'bout\nYou fucked up, bitch, fuck you!\n\n[Hook]\nI should've fucked you when I had the chance to (the chance to)\nNow I'm sittin' alone in my house and I'm wishin' you'd call me right now\nBaby, perhaps I should have been less nicer than I was to you\nCause this seems like all the good girls go for bad guys\nAnd good guys get left behind\n\n[Verse 3]\nThat's just the way that the story goes\nDeep down bitches ain't nothing but clueless, horny hoes\nThey'll fill ya life up with drama like it's the Maury show\nShe'll turn her back on you even though she had sworn she won't\nI never felt this sore before, here's what you do to be fair\nYou get a girl, fuck her while the opportunity is there, cause if you don't\nSome other nigga will, best believe this shit is real and\nWhen you find out what she's been doin' you'll fall and get the chills\nLove is just a battlefield, some bitches be gettin' killed\nNiggas too, it's the truth, better run and get your shield\nHoes will make ya think they at home waitin' for ya, sittin' still\nBut really, she's out with that guy you don't like and she's gettin' drilled\nMy heart is forever swollen, why'd I let you ever hold it?\nGirl, you was my Bella and I thought I was your Edward Cullen\nThere's no rules to hop onto your boat, you'll take whatever floats it\nBitch, you turned my heart into a cave no one should ever go in\n[Bridge]\nI can't stand these stupid bitches\nMan, I just wanna take my hand\nAnd put it around their fucking neck\nAnd choke the fuck outta them! Ooh!\nFuck 'em all!\n\n[Hook]\nI should've fucked you when I had the chance to (the chance to)\nNow I'm sittin' alone in my house and I'm wishin' you'd call me right now\nBaby, perhaps I should have been less nicer than I was to you\nCause this seems like all the good girls go for bad guys\nAnd good guys get left behind\nI should've fucked you when I had the chance to (the chance to)\nNow I'm sittin' alone in my house and I'm wishin' you'd call me right now\nBaby, perhaps I should have been less nicer than I was to you\nCause this seems like all the good girls go for bad guys\nAnd good guys get left behind20Embed"

Of course it is!\nI'd run around crazy like the Afghans do in some black camp boots wearin' a fuckin' Batman suit\nAnd scream at bitches like I'm Fatman Scoop (C'MERE!)\nAnd tell them to take a deep breath cause this will be their last chance to\nI'd hate on everyone who's sane and gifted (Yup)\nThen claim that my brain is missing while sniffing cocaine\nAnd then cut my dick for the Pain Olympics\nIf I was crazy I would go pick up the mic and use it\nAnd tell Dwayne Carter that I really like his music (Shit)\n[Hook]\nBut I'm not crazy\nI'm just a tad bit strange\nI can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain\nOh no, not my fault\nSo don't blame me\nI swear to you that I'm not really crazy\n(Ah!) Crazy (Ah!) Crazy\n\n[Verse 2: Cryptic Wisdom]\nIf I was manic I probably woulda neglected my responsibilities and made society respect it\nI'd walk around in a dress with a can of gas\nAnd blow up a mothafucka for laughing with half a match\nDig up all the baby cadavers and grab a basket\nAnd shoot them through every window of every crib that I'm passing\nI'd probably be back a couple hours later to fuck 'em with every bottle\nI cut up within my labor\nTake a breather, make a haste of it and bounce\nToward the house it's adjacent of and chase everyone out\nAnd take em down\nTell them I'm the devil and I'm claiming everybody for a battle that's crazier than my brain is\nGrab a chainsaw, blow the fuckin' dust back\nLeave it all and still ready me a new blood bath\nRun back to the psyche ward\nCheck my perimeter and get in before they knew that I left\nYou might also like[Hook]\nBut I'm not crazy\nI'm just a tad bit strange\nI can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain\nOh no, not my fault\nSo don't blame me\nI swear to you that I'm not really crazy\n(Ah!) Crazy (Ah!) Crazy\n\n[Verse 3: SwizZz]\nYo, I won't lie, I'm not as crazy as glue\nBut if I was let me describe all the bullshit I would do\nI'd jack off with sandpaper while I'm watching the View\nPicturing Whoopi bald headed stroking cock with her boobs!\nI'll throw babies in dryers\nStrangle tweakers that fidgit\nContract HIV willfully, just to purposely give it\nI'd mug mothers on wellfare\nSwim in gallons of gas\nMeander to the batting cage and use my dick for a bat! (SHIT!)\nIf I was derranged, I'd cop me a chain\nMake it rain like Washington and throw a stripper some change\nMake her work it on the floor, pussy pop on a handstand\nLick her dirty snatch and film it all on my webcam (Oh yeah!)\nHonestly I'd be itching for gunplay\nI'll cock the .45 and shoot up church on a Sunday\nI'll hi-jack a plane while it's still on the runway\nGrope the stewardess and take the passengers' chump change!\n[Hook]\nBut I'm not crazy\nI'm just a tad bit strange\nI can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain\nOh no, not my fault\nSo don't blame me\nI swear to you that I'm not really crazy\n(Ah!) Crazy (Ah!) Crazy10Embed"

    "plain": "A 6-minute track in which Hopsin and two other emcees rap some ill verses over bare production, which happens to be essentially just beatboxing, a staple of freestyles and cyphers. They emulate a cypher that takes place at a lunch room table with high school students having fun, rapping over beatboxing and/or someone pounding their fists on the table in a set pattern.\nHopsin summarizes the song himself here."

Then guard your face and stomach\nCause I'm swinging on you like ya ass cheeks had a rope hangin' from it\nI'm out my mind, I can't configure it\nI'm way too niggerish\nI tried to read the Bible but I'm straight illiterate\nWith anger temperaments\nI put myself in strange predicaments\nThey labeled this as sick\nThe doctor says to take some Ritalin\nMan, I'm a lunatic,rockin' a crucifix\nI'll mack on any chick I feel who got the cutest tits\nI'm wanted, fugitive,robbin' yo whip to cruise in it\nSee, I'm the only kid on Elm Street that Freddy Krueger skipped\nPants saggin' cause they too loose to fit,I'm torturous\nGrab a hammer and nail for your front door and board it shut\nI stare deep in ya eyes, rip out your soul and absorb it up\nAnd have Biggie Smalls yellin' out \"call the coroner!\"\nMy groupies stay horny\nThey always call to say \"Hopsin can you fly me out to Cali?\nPlease pay for me\"\nI make that pussy pop for you like you skateboarding\nThen you can come inside like a hurricane warning\nI got a lot of sluts, I like to call it Hopsin luck\nBut now I feel like having sex with these bitches is not enough\nI needed something new for moments when I gotta bust\nSo lately I've been beating my dick with a pair of boxing gloves\nI got the maddest rhymes, how dare yo ass deny\nI'll stab you in the brain with a knife\nYou can keep that in mind\nYou talkin' shit inside yo house, cool, fine, fuck it\nI'll break in and stomp you out inside of it\nAin't tryna be ya friend\nI'll knock you out and when you wake up\nI'll just be standing there with a mischievous grin\nLike\"Ha, we meet again\"\nI'll puncture yo skin with a crack fiend's syringe\nAnd drill your nut sack to the seat you're in\nYou want props? You don't deserve it, you're not ill\nI won't stop 'til every rapper lurkin' has got chills\nWhy these niggas actin' like they certainly pop steel\nWhen only time they carry heat is serving a hot meal\nSince I was young, been on a mission to make dough\nAnd put all my niggas on like this shit was a slave boat\nSo tell me why your songs sound like skittles and rainbows?\nThat's a dead giveaway you love to listen to Wayne bro\nI'm sick and deranged when I'm spitting this strange flow\nStuck my dick in the game, that's the business I came for\nWitness my pain grow, I don't kick it with lame folks\nSimple and plain though, you gon remember my name ho, ha!\nYou might also like[Hook: Hopsin]\nYo, check it\nThis that high school lunch time cypher\nI might just step in this bitch and fuck ya life up\nI hope the principal doesn't come and give me a write up\nNow who the fuck I gotta snatch the mic from?\n[Verse 2: Passionate MC]\nI'll snatch it from anyone when I dance with Satan\nAnd detach more wigs than every female cancer patient that ever cared for a transformation\nWith a (diss joint | disjoint) sweeter than a diabetic amputation\nWhen I split niggas, clipped quicker than big pictures\nHeads get bodied with a single line like a stick figure\nCause my words are wild, and when I write\nThey can't wait for the sentence like family victims of a murder trial\nOpenly flow potently\nTighter than the choke-hold needed to put the Incredible Hulk to sleep\nTighter than the boatload of soldiers that stormed Normandy\nTighter than the hairy twat with the Virgin Mary's ovaries\nThey choke up like their throats cut when I show up\nTo keep the competition (win-free | Winfrey) like Oprah\nCause when I work with Hopsin, everybody who's hip\nIs getting (killed | kilt) like a skirt from Scotland\nThen I'll cock-back quicker than mouse traps\nAnd stare as they pull (outta here | out a hare) like magicians tricking with Top hats\nI got foreign objects\nThat'll get you (capped in America | Captain America) like Marvel Comics\nWith a strap like star guitarists\nWhen this lead of mine see ahead in time like Nostradamus\nOr swift jabs that swing left like crip flags\nWill be the reason you break (next | necks) like whiplash!\nSo who the fuck wants war with this?\nDistorted thoughts morphed this author to Spartacus\nWhen he balls his fists around the swords he lifts with the force of a horses kick\nMultiplied by the reason why god exists, and makes Thor his bitch!\nHorror flick like imagery, organs everywhere..\nYou would swear I was orchestrating a Symphony!\nIt's passion, the force within him will cause the critics to look-n' drop dead like gorgeous women, hah!\n[Hook: Hopsin & G-Mo Skee]\nYo, check it\nThis that high school lunch time cypher\nI might just step in this bitch and fuck ya life up\nFuck the principal, he can give me a fuckin' write up\nNow who the fuck I gotta snatch the mic from?\n[Verse 3: G-Mo Skee]\nDon't get this shit confused\nYou're not a person, you're delicious food\nNo matter your race, birthplace, or religious views\nAll you niggas getting chewed\nI eat a rapper, fitted cap first and then I spit out his tennis shoes\nMissing screws in my top, I don\u2019t have the patience\nI grab the chop and leave you niggas eradicated\nI never let the doctor give me shots, I'm unvaccinated\nAnd I got small pox, you can have a blanket\nGet assassinated and left with broken bones\nIf you gotta travel through the woods don\u2019t go alone\nI'm fucking bitches in a mobile home\nLike a mutated nigga from the hills have eyes with no Trojan on\nThis is paranormal activity with a dagger\nI got paranormal tendencies y'all just a pair of normal rappers\nSo why you talking like you not defenseless?\nI punch you ten times in the mouth\nAnd have your pussy asses hoppin fences\nI got suspended for a few weeks in the 8th grade\nWhen the principal caught me on the street tryna spray paint\nI bought a dozen eggs from Safeway\nAnd threw them at the muthafuckas house on the same day\nYou can get it the same way\nI'm making bitch niggas walk the plank\nIn crocodile infested water mixed with toxic waste\nBury you alive with a camera strapped across your face\nThen come back 2 weeks later and watch the tape\nYou cried like a bitch trying to make the coffin break\nYou died like a bitch instead of trying to concentrate\nI'm here to depopulate on the red carpet with a sniper rifle\nTaking out any nigga you nominate\nSo if you see me as soon as you turn the news on\nChances are I laid a nigga down like a futon\nWhile you at work dealing with groceries and coupons\nI got your bitch tossing my salad pass the croutons\n\n[Hook: Hopsin, Passionate MC, & G-Mo Skee]\nYo, check it\nThis that high school lunch time cypher\nI might just step in this bitch and fuck ya life up\nI hope the principal doesn't come and give me a write up\nNow who the fuck I gotta snatch the mic from?\n[Outro: Hopsin]\nYeah hah! Took it back to fucking lunchtime on these muthafuckas son!\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Funk Volume21Embed"

    "plain": "Following up the events that he talked about on his previous album No Shame, Hopsin once again addresses his relationship with his ex-girlfriend Alyce Madden owning-up to his past mistakes and admitting he still has feelings for her and he wishes that it never ended with her.\n\nAt the end of the music video, his ex actually agrees to talk to him and looks like she forgave him, but the next shot shows that it only happened in his imagination as he was sitting alone in the dark.\n\nHe wrote on Instagram that:\n\nThis video is a re-enactment of a dream that I keep on having and a prayer I keep sending to god in hopes that things can be right with us one day and we can be a happy family.\n\nThe song and the video were announced on Instagram the day before they dropped, along with Hopsin writing to his fans on an Insta-story that:\n\nA lot of you will be able to relate to the new song and video because you have been in the situation before. A lot of you might clown me. But all I know to do is speak from my heart when I make music. Whether I get clowned or not, you will remember me for being real."

A lot of you might clown me. But all I know to do is speak from my heart when I make music. Whether I get clowned or not, you will remember me for being real."

   "lyrics": "The Old Us Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI know this is super random\nWe done had our ups and downs and I done threw some tantrums\nI honestly care about you way more than you could fathom\nAnd God knows I ain't lyin\u2019, if only you could ask Him\nI know you think our happiness just comes and goes in occasions\nWhen I leave Earth, I wanna be frozen in place\nWith a rose in a case full of love notes I wrote for the days I got to be next to you\nThat's how I feel and no one can change it, but\nI gotta get this tension off of my chest\n'Cause every day I feel a constant regret\nNow I can reflect to see the issues we never dissolved or suppressed\nI guess it\u2019s only right that karma was next\nAnd I'ma be open and honest with you, your absence is causing the stress\nI wish the pain I feel would lay inside a coffin and rest\nAnd it's only you who can soften my flesh\nBut still you run me in circles and lately you ain't been responding to texts\nAnd now my only option is to act like I don't fucking need you\nI bottle up the pain although the bottle's fucking see-through\nI pray to God and wish that we could wash it up and re-do\nGuess every love story just ain't got a fucking sequel\nI just need to know if you feel the same\nWhy can't we kill the games and reconcile?\nI know you still afraid, we both stuck\nThere\u2019s no trust, we gave our souls up the moment love had approached us, but\u2014\n[Chorus]\nCan we go back to the old us?\n\u2019Cause I just don't fuck with this new you\nLately you ain\u2019t showin' no love\nYou act like I never knew you\nWe need to stop the games right now\nLet's stop the games, baby\nI need you to ease the pain right now\nI need you to keep it real with me, my love\nCan we go back to the old us?\n'Cause I just don\u2019t fuck with this new you\nLately you ain't showin' no love\nYou act like I never knew you\nWe need to stop the games right now\nLet's stop the games, baby\nI need you to ease the pain right now\nI need you to keep it real with me, my love\nCan we go back to the old us?\n\n[Verse 2]\nOn my end there was mistakes made, I had too much pride to take blame\nThe moment my fame came, my ways changed\nI couldn't stay sane and started making our sunny days rain\nAnd even though my life has moved on, our history's too strong to forget\nI won't pretend I ain't stained\nAnd if you open up my fucking chest and take a look in my heart\nI swear to God you gon' see yo' engraved name\nHow you gon' leave me hanging?\nHow you gon' leave me achin'?\nI never did get my closure, so how you gon' mediate it?\nHow you gon' be when Zade is old enough to understand that his daddy isn't around?\nHow we gon' be related?\nAnd I just want my family on track, that's the plan we both had\nShit is sad because I'm askin' for a chance we don't have\nI fucking love you\nAnd I just had to grab my notepad just to write a song for you saying\u2014\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nCan we go back to the old us?\n'Cause I just don't fuck with this new you\nLately you ain't showin' no love\nYou act like I never knew you\nWe need to stop the games right now\nLet's stop the games, baby\nI need you to ease the pain right now\nI need you to keep it real with me, my love\nCan we go back to the old us?\n'Cause I just don't fuck with this new you\nLately you ain't showin' no love\nYou act like I never knew you\nWe need to stop the games right now\nLet's stop the games, baby\nI need you to ease the pain right now\nI need you to keep it real with me, my love\nCan we go back to the old us?\n\n[Outro]\nI'm sorry6Embed"

At the time I never thought you was it\nI do now but shit you're gone, so I just offer you this\nA song to you, through it I open the crack in my chest\nAnd show the whole world I've always had a lack of respect\nFor women who enter my life, I look to vengeance as knife\nIntentions to fight, if you thinking I was senseless you right\nNow every sentence I write, I think twice on it so I don't regret\n'Cause only stress lies in a sinful mind of loneliness\nI'm an unholy mess, put me in a hole to rest\nWelcome to my life this is how painful my stories get\nYou might also like[Pre-Hook]\nShe said, \"You never loved me, you just controlled me\nIf you fuck around I'm calling the police\"\nBut all I wanted to say was I'm sorry\nOh, how I wish that could tell you\n\n[Hook]\nYou're gone, you're dead\nYou'll never know that I was sorry\nJust leave me alone, stay out my head\nI wish that I could tell you\nYou're gone, you're dead\nYou'll never know that I was sorry\nJust leave me alone, stay out my head\nI wish that I could tell you\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow use this track as a lesson\nAll you guys out there who have some aggression\nTowards your woman it don't have to get hectic\nThat crap is pathetic, now look at me I have to regret it\nI can't go near her or nothing, she'll probably have me arrested\nThe only thing I could do is just make a track with a message\nAnd hope she hears it so she could know I was badly affected\nI never meant to be that type of guy\nBut I realized that I was, and because of it I'm throwing my sinister life aside\nI can cry at any moment just thinking about it\nSometimes I hide it from the folks that I'm hanging around with\nI should apply for a new soul 'cause I think it's invalid\nSomebody told me when I die I'll be safe but I doubt it\nThe grudge she holds against me, it hurts me so severely\nShe won't come near me, I thought that time was supposed to cure me\nI'm so alone and weary, writing songs to heal me\nI swear that I'm sorry Heather, I mean it so sincerely\n[Pre-Hook]\nShe said, \"You never loved me, you just controlled me\nIf you fuck around I'm calling the police\"\nBut all I wanted to say was I'm sorry\nOh, how I wish that could tell you\n\n[Hook]\nYou're gone, you're dead\nYou'll never know that I was sorry\nJust leave me alone, stay out my head\nI wish that I could tell you\nYou're gone, you're dead\nYou'll never know that I was sorry\nJust leave me alone, stay out my head\nI wish that I could tell you14Embed"

    "plain": "In the opening song of the album, Hopsin describes the situation of how and why he was banned from Australia due to the actions of his ex-girlfriend.\n\nThroughout the song we hear Hopsin talking and explaining to the Australian police officer what happened in the hotel room with his girlfriend at the time.\n\nHopsin already talked about this situation through his Instagram post:\n\nThat one time when I was a dumb ass nigga and bought an expensive ass ring for my petty 20 week pregnant ex and flew to Australia to propose, then found out she was being a hoe working at a strip club and sleeping with her gym trainer behind my back\u2026then she dodged the paternity test then told the cops I beat her and I got kicked out of Australia when all I did was push her onto a damn bed from so much hurt and frustration."

Let's go, dickhead!\n\u2014 Officer, you said I was only gonna be here for 30 minutes. It's been five hours, man, what's goi\u2014\n\u2014 Yeaaah, shut your fuckin' mouth, ya fuckwit, before I fuckin' bash ya!\n\u2014 Man, what the fuck are you talkin'\u2014\n\u2014 Go inside, ya fuckin' wombat!\n\u2014 Man, this is stupid.\n\u2014 Go on, sit down!\n\u2014 *sighs* Oh, god.\n\u2014 Now, your missus claims you assaulted her.\n\u2014 Psssssst.\n\u2014 Bloody oath, man, why'd ya fuckin' beat her?\n\u2014 Man, I didn't fucking beat her! Listen, I'm telling you\u2026\n[Verse 1: Hopsin]\nI got her the engagement ring that she liked, booked a new flight\nTo come to Sydney just to see her, start a new life\nMan, she's twenty weeks pregnant and I was tryna do right\nFor us, a family, the kid, but maybe I was too nice\nMy homie text me a picture and I just burst into anger\nIt was my girl in a bed with her personal trainer\nI text my homie like, \"Yo, where you find this?\"\nHe says, \"Snapchat, bro, it's all on my timeline, shit.\"\nSwear it struck a fuckin' nerve in my chest\nI looked at my girl and said, \"Get a paternity test!\"\nShe said, \"No! Don't you get all worked and upset\nI only slept in his bed right after work just to rest.\"\nI said, \"What? You expect me to believe that?\nHa, alright, yeah I'll 'relax,' guess it doesn't seem bad\nMy girlfriend's with a buff nigga gettin' t-bagged.\"\nOfficer, correct me if I'm wrong but she needed her head detached\nI said, \"Bitch, I can't believe this shit!\nDoes he know you're pregnant? Is that his kid?\nLook how big my headache is! This whole time y'all havin' sex and shit\nWhat type of nigga would fuck a pregnant chick?!\"\nI said, \"Let's get this paternity test, I'm not kiddin', bitch!\"\nShe said, \"No, I'm not gettin' it!\"\nOfficer, I ain't seen her in months, I couldn't trust the lyin' whore\nPlus she told me she slept with this guy before\nAnd then I said, \"You know what? Forget it, it's all good, never mind\"\nShit was makin' my blood pressure high\nI love her unconditionally, you know, I can't pretend I ain't never lied\nFor the moment, I guess I'll let her slide\nShe said, \"If you don't want to take care of this kid, Marcus, then say so.\"\nI said, \"Wait, no, it's mine too, I can't go\nHow you gonna support this kid without me? You don't make dough.\"\nShe said, \"Hahaha. I make loads.\"\nShe had six grand cash\nI said, \"But you was broke two weeks ago! How you makin' chips that fast?\"\nShe said, \"I bartend, I made it all in tips, haha.\"\nI said, \"Girl, you must take me as a big jackass.\"\nI'm like, \"Please, we both know money is hard to come by.\"\nHer bullshit might fly over the heads of some guys\nOfficer, she's always tellin' dumb lies\nI've known her for six years, and she hasn't lifted a finger one time!\nI said, \"Where'd you get the cash from?\"\nShe said, \"I bartend, duh, from tips, I'm a waitress.\"\nI said, \"Where'd you get the cash from?\"\nShe started stutterin' like, \"Uhm, Marcus, I've... wait, just\u2014\"\nI said, \"Where'd you get the cash from?\"\nShe said, \"Ok, ok, I'll tell you, just promise me you won't get mad.\"\nI'm like, \"Baby, where'd you get the cash from?\"\nShe said, \"I work at a strip club\u2026 it's how I made the six grand.\"\nI said, \"Woah\nNo\u2026 no!\"\nI fell down in tears\nMy heart broke, I turned cold\nI don't want the girl that I'm in love with doin' ho shit\nIf she needed cash I woulda loaned it, and she knows it\nThey won't let me get a refund on this twenty-thousand-dollar ring\nFuck, my head, it hurts, I need some ibuprofen\nYou might also like[Interlude: Hopsin & Police Officer]\n\u2014 Yeah, Mr. Hopson, you need a minute?\n\u2014 Um, may I have some water please?\n\u2014 Ah, no worries at all.\n\u2014 I don't mean to cry and get emotional, but all this just bothers me.\n\u2014 Yeah, it's alright, you're good\u2026 yeah here ya go, mate!\n\u2014 Thanks\u2026 *sips water*\n\n[Verse 2: Hopsin]\nI wasn't me no more\nI looked her in the eyes and straight told her\n(What'd you say to her?)\nI need you to tell me where this strip club is at\nOr this family we're about to have is over\nI said, \"Tell me where it's at!\" \u2014 she said, \"No.\"\nI said, \"You about to make me mad!\" \u2014 she said, \"So?\"\nI said, \"Bitch, you better panic and run, the damage is done\nYou're doin' this four months away from havin' my son! UGHN!\"\nI told her I would always have her back\nI forgave her after all the careless acts\nI had one question, and she couldn't share the facts\nThe strip club \u2014 how come she couldn't tell me where it's at?\nWho the fuck she fuckin' in there? Whose dick she suckin' in there?\nShakin' her fuckin' butt in the air\nIt's like we've argued for a thousand fuckin' hours, I'm annoyed\nAnd I was at the point where somethin' was about to get destroyed\nI grabbed her purse, threw that shit across the room\nI fuckin' launched it too\nIt was filled with makeup kits and all of her jewels\nI blacked out; she said, \"What the fuck is wrong with you?\"\nShe got up out the bed to get it, I pushed her ass back in it\nI said, \"We still talkin', bitch, you and I ain't finished\nNow, this strip club, where is it?\nBitch, where the fuck is it?!\"\nI said, \"You know what? Fuck it. Awesome. Fine.\"\nIn the process of all this drama, I'd lost my mind\nI felt lost and blind: the gym trainer, the strip club\nThe ring, the baby, she really crossed the line\nAnd then I finally came down and all the madness was finished\nThen she invited me to dinner with her family in Penrith\nI said, \"I ain't goin' witchu, you can leave now\nI need to stay in this hotel room and figure some things out.\"\nOfficer, I know you ain't gon' sympathize\nI don't approve of any man puttin' hands on his girlfriend or wife\nEspecially when she's pregnant with his kid inside\nHonestly feel like I wasn't in the wrong, but still I wasn't in the right\nAsk her, she ain't got no bruises on her\nI'm human, there's only so much that a dude can conquer\nShe knew that her actions reflected true dishonor\nAnd tried to cover it, sayin' I'm an abusive monster\nThat's bullshit, huh, and that fast, poof\nAll of her wrongs are in the past, cool\nShe's just the innocent white girl\nAnd I'm the Black guy who always gets mad, true!\nI know y'all 'bout to make it hard for me to get back in Australia\nMan, this shit is fuckin' sad, dude\nI still don't know if this baby is mine or not\nSo when he's born, who's gon' be the fuckin' dad? You?16Embed"

In the song, Hop shares a story of himself going to an Asian massage parlor and getting sexual pleasure from a masseuse.\n\nThe song was released on October 12th with an official music video. The music video was considered so inappropriate that it was flagged and taken down by YouTube.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/hopsin/status/918755336596500480"

   "lyrics": "My Love Lyrics[Verse 1]\nBaby, I know we goin' through shit and you feel like there ain't no solution\nYou say I'm a nuisance and think I be playin' these games with your heart and not purposely bruise it\nThat's when I lose it and flip, put the blame all on you like it's all your fault\nNow I'm goin' through your phone, you goin' through mine, and we wrestlin', I'm hopin' you don't call no cops\nBaby, I love you, don't be jealous of females I know that I've met down the way\nYou mention they name on a regular basis and you just be givin' the space in my brain\nYou'll look me straight in the face, swear that I'm stickin' my penis up in every girl that I'm friends with\nAnd that's the moment I say, \"I don't even know why I'm in a relationship, I want to end it\"\nLet's just chill the fuck out, girl, we livin' in the same damn house\nEverywhere I go, you go, and you go, I go, so what we naggin' about?\nShit, not a goddamn thing, maybe we just like to hear ourselves talkin'\nWe do it way too often, I think we both lost it\nOur love just might be in the coffin, oh shit\n[Hook]\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love\n\n[Verse 2]\nI feel like your parents don't like me, I hate that you tell 'em our problems\nSee, when I first met 'em I knew that they fell in love with me, but then I fell straight to the bottom\nNow your daddy textin' me sayin' to fly you home and he bein' so passive aggressive\nThen I'm like \"Sure you gon' pay for her ticket?\" That is the question, dammit I'm stressin'\nI've been sufferin' from manic depression, baby it takes a real man to confess it\nI don't care if you confront me with issues you got, just be careful with how you address it\n'Cause sometimes you attackin' me the wrong way, and then my mind think the wrong way\nThen all of a sudden I be actin' like I got no brain, and I'm doin' foul shit like it's okay\nBut don't say I ain't ever tryna make things better, you been the only focus since the day we met up\nEvery time we get into it, you got me wishin' that I never broke up with my girlfriend back in Maryada\nYou say I don't love you then I don't know what else to do\n'Cause I don't want nobody else but you\nI know that I've been hurtin' you and you've been hurtin' me\nSo baby let's get it right because fightin' doesn't help the bruise, we both lose\nYou might also like[Hook]\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love\n\n[Bridge]\nWhy do we fight so often?\nThese games are oh so ridiculous though we cannot let this shit get to us\nWe just need to focus on the brighter side so we can make it\nAnd if you ain't doin' somethin' I like, then I promise you that I'ma be a little more patient\n\n[Verse 3]\n'Cause these bad vibes are contagious and our relationship is now breakin'\nAnd I know, I know, I know your heart is constantly achin'\nIt's like I snatched it out of your chest and tore it up, just tore it up\nAnd I, I played the bad guy towards you more than once, yes, more than once\nMan, this shit be frustratin' me\nIf you ain't the one then who may it be?\nWe tried to make love, but we made a beast\nNow we just stuck 'cause we can't agree\nThis is my heart, please take a piece\nAnd put it in a safe place to remind you\nThere's a million other guys in the world to choose\nBut none of 'em will ever love you like I do, baby\n[Hook]\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love11Embed"

(Will they ever learn to love me?)\nDon\u2019t fucking call me, stop tryna reach me\nI ain\u2019t tryna hear all of your bullshit, just leave me\n[Verse 2]\nThe underground ain\u2019t been the same since I emerged from it\nNiggas hear my name and they just hate and throw some dirt on it\nTalkin' 'bout I blew up and just left them in the dust\nBut we ain\u2019t friends, mothafucka, we ain\u2019t never kicked it once\nYou better zip it shut, I\u2019m respectful\nBut if I spot you, that\u2019s the only time that I won\u2019t ever give a fuck\nYour words can make a difference, do not forget\nIf you run your mouth and talk shit, you payin' for what comes out of it\nBitch niggas acting all macho, jealous 'cause they ain\u2019t got dough\nWhile they still openin' up for me at my show\nSmilin' comin' over to me, like I\u2019m the coldest MC\nAnd then you badmouth the moment I leave?\nAight, I got it, since I\u2019m in the limelight\nYou niggas try to look cool by not being hyped about my hype\nSimple and plain, better watch where your missiles are aimed\nInsult my name, you\u2019ll rekindle a flame, nigga\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThere's no room to drive at the end of the road\nWhen you're living in the cold, not wearing a coat\nThe breeze turns tears to snow\nWill they ever learn to love me? (Will they ever learn to love me?)\nDon\u2019t fucking call me, stop tryna reach me\nI ain\u2019t tryna hear all of your bullshit, just leave me\n[Verse 3]\nI\u2019m about to lock myself in my basement and dig my grave inside\nAll jokes aside, man, I see no reason to stay alive\nIf I do it, I won\u2019t even say goodbye\n\u201cYo-o, but you\u2019re Hopsin and you have so many fa-ans!\u201c, yeah, great advice\nI\u2019m not lucky; outside of Hopsin, there's no one who loves me\nI come home to absolutely nothing\nNobody pays any mind to Marcus, they treat me like I\u2019m retarded\nAnd just want me to slave away as an artist\nIt don\u2019t make any sense to me, no one wants to get to know the real me\nThey just want some pictures for they friends to see\nI deal with this kind of stress endlessly, fuck this damn industry\nLook at all the shit that it just did to me\nI don\u2019t care about no big collab or tryna swim in cash\nI just want a family I can watch the TV with and laugh\nUntil then, I\u2019m on the dark side\nI\u2019m the fuckin\u2019 Dark Knight, startin\u2019 bar fights, it's a hard life\n[Chorus]\nThere's no room to drive at the end of the road\nWhen you're living in the cold, not wearing a coat\nThe breeze turns tears to snow\nWill they ever learn to love me? (Will they ever learn to love me?)\nDon\u2019t fucking call me, stop tryna reach me\nI ain\u2019t tryna hear all of your bullshit, just leave me30Embed"

    "plain": "On this wordplay-heavy track, Hop describes his cynical view on life in the format of a scientific study (including a hypothesis and conclusion). He states that he\u2019s better off alone, as well as letting the haters know he\u2019s coming for them.\n\nHopsin also has a song of the same title, \u201cTwisted\u201d, with underground rapper Einstagator, where Hop layed his hook and verse. The song was part of a mixtape album called Mass Confusion.

Fuck being positive!\nI'm in my prime, but I ain't no Optimus\nShit's about to go down, I can promise it, biatch!\n[Hook]\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nBig shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nRespect my name when it leave your mouth\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nBig shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nRespect my name when it leave your mouth\nYou better not get it\u2014\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow you tryna drive from the backseat?\nI been runnin' things like an athlete\nPedal to the metal goin' max speed\nSippin' Red Bull 'cause I barely had sleep\nLaboratory smellin' like a gas leak\nGoin' up in flames when the track beat\nI made a 100 motherfuckin' K last week\nNiggas feelin' me like Mr. King's last speech\nWhen you mix in a lot of hardcore revenge\nA pitchfork and sins, then misfortune wins\nYou can cop you a house up in Porter Ranch\nAnd pull up on these hoes in Porsche or Benz\nSo many fake friends, I'm bored of friends\nLife feel just like I'm bordered in\nHave I talked to the Lord? I sorta been\nI been battlin' with life in a tournament\nLet me spit the facts\nBitch, relax, I lift the match and build the shit from scratch\nFirst empire I built, shit collapsed\nHad bad splits 'til my lips were chapped\nBack in high school where not many kids could rap\nBut I engineered they ass just for cash\nNiggas couldn't see where my head was at\nIn my living room where I rest the plaques\nSo here's my conclusion\nAs I sit in this booth I condition to bruise\nI'm vicious and gruesome, you're listenin' to\nSome premeditated murder, yes, I meant to intrude\nIt's Panorama city, madness up against me\nUC Prodigy, the rap attack committee\nI been rappin' 'fore the world tell me not to go sittin', like\u2014\nYou might also like[Hook]\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nBig shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nRespect my name when it leave your mouth\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nBig shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nRespect my name when it leave your mouth\nYou better not get it\u2014\n\n[Bridge]\nWelcome to my euphoria\nThis is a place where I'm too victorious\nThis ain't a place where the grass is greener\nThis is a place full of mad demeanor\nLook sideways, catch a bag of fever\nNiggas stay shooked like they havin' seizures\nMy life's a movie, this track\u2019s a teaser\nSo recognize the real nigga\n\n[Hook]\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nBig shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nRespect my name when it leave your mouth\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nBig shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nRespect my name when it leave your mouth\nYou better not get it\u201414Embed"

In the second he takes us into the perspective of a fan whose life as been profoundly affected by Hopsin\u2019s music. It finally switches back to the surprised and inspired Hopsin perspective."

Then come and get some\nI'm takin' the cake, and all that's left for y'all is the pieces I bit from\nSee I ain't buddy-buddy with rappers because that shit is fake\nMost of y'all morals is fucked up, you on a different page\nYou get no props just 'cause you getting paid\nIf you garbage we ain't doing business, point blank, I discriminate\nAnd I don't do no bullshit collabs to get my name poppin'\nThat ain't even considered a safe option\nAnd that just ain't Hopsin, I paid homage, now I'm straight wilin'\nNow turn this shit up while the bass knockin', now c'mon\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThe fiends are knocking at my door\nShould I give them what they're asking for?\nThey want it (want it)\nNeed it (need it), have it (have it)\nWoah\u2014oh (woah)\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nKnock Madness\nSo what the fuck y'all need from me?\nI'm here to make these fiends believe\nThey want it (want it)\nNeed it (need it), gotta have it (have it)\nWoah\u2014oh (woah)\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nKnock Madness\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I be gettin' comments like\n\"Hop, what's the hold up with your new shit, man? You be taking forever son\nYo I'ma stop waiting, I'm getting my hopes up\nWith your work ethic it ain't gon' never come\nYou had the XXL cover in 2012\nAnd I thought you would soon prevail, but homie, you ain't doing well\nYou hit us with that Ill Mind shit and that was cool as hell\nBut when it comes to your album, you never got no news to tell\nYour whole career is just a train wreck\nYou toured around the world for 3 years, but you always performed the same set\nI been asked you to come to my city, but you ain't came yet\nI guess you ain't in it for love, you just want that pay check\nIf I was you, then I wouldn't be too proud\nYou signed Dizzy not too long ago when he's bigger than you now\nYou said you saving hip-hop, well, save this shit\nAnd all I hear is wack niggas and I hate this shit\nHomie I stopped being a scrub because of you\nI stopped playin' these bitches in the club and fell in love because of you\nMy dad heard your song and he stopped doin' drugs because of you\nI learned to rap and even built a little buzz because of you\nBut you take it for granted, thinking you have it made\nSittin' back in the shade, Hopsin, there's people that you have to save\nThis is beyond music\nYou speak life into these motherfuckers, Hop, you have a gift, so when you gon' use it?\"\nDamn, I have that much of an impact?\nMy rhymes did that? Sometimes, I really feel my shit's wack\nThat's why I kick back, but fuck this shit, yo, where my pen at?\nI'm 'bout to kill this shit and make niggas just wanna quit rap\nI'm causing havoc, layin' the rappers like a hammock\nIf I want the fucking planet, I can have it, now try to snatch it\nOnly God can stop my violent habits\nYou niggas average, I ain't even in my prime and still I'm twice the savage\nC'mon\n[Chorus]\nThe fiends are knocking at my door\nShould I give them what they're asking for?\nThey want it (want it)\nNeed it (need it), have it (have it)\nWoah\u2014oh (woah)\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nKnock Madness\nSo what the fuck y'all need from me?\nI'm here to make these fiends believe\nThey want it (want it)\nNeed it (need it), gotta have it (have it)\nWoah\u2014oh (woah)\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nKnock Madness27Embed"

How'd I get the world to rock with me?\nHow'd I get this killing following?\nHow'd I go from being no one in Panorama City to being famous from boggling everyone's mind?\nI don't go to bed as early, I be up all night up until 7:30 in the morning\nMy legacy's legendary, you will never catch a nigga stepping dirty\nI know God has got me, I don't ever worry\nI get it by any means necessary\nThe haters want my career dead and buried, that's a long shot, fuckin' Stephen Curry\nBitch I know, I done revived my whole plan\nFuck the matrix, I had to break it and now I'm the program\nYou won't ever catch me bowin' down in the eyes of no man\nWhy should I be co-dependent? Mothafucka I'm the golden ticket\nThis is my show and you don't get no admission\nYou won't survive a head-on collision\nMan, I'm so committed, I done broke a business\nFroze a business, the new U-P coalition\nGot you, eyein' all of this dough I'm gettin', pussy\nNiggas do not get no percentage when it's time to rock\nI'm the coldest with it\nSo don't ever question it, it is evident\nJust when you thought a nigga fell off\nI am back from the dead again, I am The Revenant\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMan, life is a struggle, you know what it be like (For real)\nSo I gotta get it, I'm sure you can see why (I do)\nIf niggas ain't eating, we hitting the green light (Come on)\nI'm bout to put on for 8-18 like\n\n[Chorus]\nBitch I'm 'bout the business (I got 'em talkin' lately)\nBitch I'm 'bout the business (Yeah, a nigga popping lately)\nBitch I'm 'bout the business (I see you watchin' baby)\nBitch I'm 'bout the business (Yeah, a nigga popping, ain't he?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy life isn't the same, why would it be?\nI got haters who thinkin' so crookedly (I do)\nI'm fed up, I said fuck it and took a leap (I did)\nNow I'm killing shit, my nigga, look at me (Damn)\nA boss in the building got niggas cryin' steady, caught in they feelings\nI'm like a deadly roman dog in the village\nIt's fuck 'em all if they involved with the villain\nI shit on anything you thought was appealin'\nI hope you eatin' with the pay decreased\nI be feastin' just to say the least\nI might flee away and take a freak\nOut to Fiji, maybe stay a week (Woo)\nMaybe three, shit I'm debatin' geez\nAll the problems when you makin' cheese, nigga\nI'ma reinvent the 8-18, goddamn it\nI'm sorry I had to stunt\nSometimes I'm a massive cunt\nI clown niggas and I laugh a bunch\nTalk shit when I grab my nuts\nI'm DMing and all the ratchet sluts\nMy story doesn't happen much\nI backed off, now I'm back for lunch\nI pack a punch, get active chump\nYou probably had to hunch\nI do best when I'm mad as fuck\nI'm mad corrupt, this accurate\nMan, I couldn't see myself stuck in the trench\nI just had to give it one hundred percent\nMan I couldn't live with myself knownin' all this time I been on this planet wasn't for shit\nShout out to all the fans who been holding me down ever since day one\nKeepin' my name up, FV is bankrupt and the Prodigy came up\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nMan, life is a struggle, you know what it be like (For real)\nSo I gotta get it, I'm sure you can see why (I do)\nIf niggas ain't eating we hitting the green light (Come on)\nI'm bout to put on for 8-18 like\n\n[Chorus]\nBitch I'm 'bout the business (I got 'em talkin' lately)\nBitch I'm 'bout the business (Yeah, a nigga popping lately)\nBitch I'm 'bout the business (I see you watchin' baby)\nBitch I'm 'bout the business (Yeah, a nigga popping, ain't he?)\n\n[Bridge]\nFuck any nigga who tryna kill what I'm doin' here\nI've been up for nights just tryna keep this shit movin' (A nigga popping lately)\nNigga fuck the club, these hoes can wait, if you don't relate\nThen you should probably keep an eye out on shit that you doin' (A nigga popping lately)\nAnd who said it can't be me, I've been up grindin' for 80 weeks nigga\nI got no time for ADD niggas, I'm tryna put on for 8-18 nigga\nI'm tryna put on for 8-18 nigga\nI'm bout to put on for 8-18 like\n\n[Chorus]\nBitch I'm 'bout the business (I got 'em talkin' lately)\nBitch I'm 'bout the business (Yeah, a nigga popping lately)\nBitch I'm 'bout the business (I see you watchin' baby)\nBitch I'm 'bout the business (Yeah, a nigga popping, ain't he?)\nDamn30Embed"

    "plain": "This is a song in which Hopsin clearly expresses his raw hate; in hip hop, rap, and other rappers. He dominates the game.\n\nA typical Hopsin song that we love and appreciate!\n\nIn the words of Hopsin himself, to XXL Magazine in 2013, he says about the song:\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the most intense rap song on the album. It\u2019s not a song that\u2019s going to slowly change anybody\u2019s life. It\u2019s just a rap song that\u2019s pimp, to just have bars and sound dope. The energy on that, you\u2019ll probably hear it and want to cut somebody\u2019s throat. When you\u2019re working out, you just hear some workout music. The song just amps you up so much. It\u2019s so hyped to where you want to punch a hole in somebody\u2019s head or punch a hole through the wall. It\u2019s one of those songs. It\u2019s the hip-hop sinister. If you were to picture the super dark sinister of hip-hop who is standing on top of the freaking dark mountain in the night and the moon is in the sky saying beast mode lyrics, it\u2019s crazy. If the Incredible Hulk was to rap, that\u2019s what that song will be.\u201d"

He dominates the game.\n\nA typical Hopsin song that we love and appreciate!\n\nIn the words of Hopsin himself, to XXL Magazine in 2013, he says about the song:\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the most intense rap song on the album. It\u2019s not a song that\u2019s going to slowly change anybody\u2019s life. It\u2019s just a rap song that\u2019s pimp, to just have bars and sound dope. The energy on that, you\u2019ll probably hear it and want to cut somebody\u2019s throat. When you\u2019re working out, you just hear some workout music. The song just amps you up so much. It\u2019s so hyped to where you want to punch a hole in somebody\u2019s head or punch a hole through the wall. It\u2019s one of those songs. It\u2019s the hip-hop sinister. If you were to picture the super dark sinister of hip-hop who is standing on top of the freaking dark mountain in the night and the moon is in the sky saying beast mode lyrics, it\u2019s crazy. If the Incredible Hulk was to rap, that\u2019s what that song will be.\u201d"

Where is it at?\nI haven't seen it, who dares to attack a genius?\nYou'll get managed I'll have you gag your penis\nUntil you throw up your own liver (nuts)\nI don't give a (fuck), the flow ripper (what)\nYou might also like[Hook]\nI'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister\nMurder, nigga murder\n'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up\nMurder, nigga murder\nI'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister\nMurder, nigga murder\n'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up\nMurder, nigga murder\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow if I stop being who I am, that would upset me\nI'll never change for none of your wack-ass deadbeats\nI struggled to change for J. Christ to accept me\nI don't even change clothes, shit not even my bed sheets\nWhen I step inside the booth and rhyme\nRappers commit suicide\nAnd jump in front of a moving semi-truck\nLike it was cool to die\nNiggas is watered down\nFuck it it's time to scuba dive\nBetter get on your knees and pray to God and hope that you survive\nKillin' rappers like I condone violence\nI murder you and when your soul is floatin' to hell I ghostride it\nYou won't last living in this cold climate, so don't try it\nI know I'm ill, well I don't need no pussies to co-sign it\nCommercial niggas thinking they carry the torch\nIt's going to be very hilarious when I bury your corpse\nSo next time you spit a fucking rhyme that's too simple\nI'll jump kick your ass through the glass of the booth window\n[Hook]\nI'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister\nMurder, nigga murder\n'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up\nMurder, nigga murder\nI'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister\nMurder, nigga murder\n'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up\nMurder, nigga murder21Embed"

All of it dealt with spending my paper\nAnd I was nice, I'd give 'em cash, I'd show sympathy\nI gave him some, him, and her, I'm just lending cheese\nNow I'm just looked at like an ATM machine\nIf I don't give my friends my money, shit, I'm the enemy\nI had about a million new best friends that I just met\nSome were plotting to build me a death bed\nAll because they kept on putting wack songs out that no one's impressed with\nSo outta jealousy they'd diss me, you fucking guessed it (Ha)\nAt least I had my squad; Jarren, Dizzy, Hoppa, SwizZz\nI knew we'd stick together, stuck in this chaotic biz\nWe had it all figured out and had a lot to give\nIt was Funk Volume for life, who want a problem, bitch?\nThen all the sudden, out of nowhere we parted ways\n2016 \u2013 those were some of my darkest days\nAsk us all, \"Whose fault was it?\" Ain't hard to say\nBut it was due to money and all of our bonds had started to fade\nMonths later, my girl told me she's pregnant\nThis was something I never expected\nHer and I weren't on good terms at the time, man, it was hectic\nAnd I was scared if she kept this baby I might regret it\nMainly because her and I had a fucking toxic relationship\nLast thing we need is a fucking toddler to raise in it\nHaving a baby is great, but not as amazing when you got two parents who always fighting, hollering, breaking shit\nPresent day, all my people are gone\nNo real friends, just leeches around eating the crumbs\nNo family bonds, no FV, can't be with my son\nNo fucking girlfriend, I swear I thought that she was the one\nI feel alone and I struggle to get my fans what they want from me\nI'm struggling to build this UP company\nI'm begging on my fucking knees like, \"God, please help me 'cause I can't fucking breathe\nI'm tryna smile, but pain is cutting deep\nShow me that I'm more than just a rapper\nShow me that this life that I've been working on is meant to be more than just a disaster\"\nI hope this message I'm sending is floating up above\nInstead of focusing on fame, I should've focused on the love\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI don't want it no more, I don't want it no more, no more\n(No, no, no, no, no, no)\nI don't want it no more, I don't want it no more, no more\n(No, no, no, no, no, no)\nI don't want it no more (No more) I don't want it no more\n(No more)\nNo more (No more) (No, no, no, no, no, no)\nI don't want it no more (No more) I don't want it no more\n(No more)\nNo more (No more) (No, no, no, no, no, no)\n\n[Outro]\nI gotta go find myself\nI hope you all can understand34Embed"

(Look bitch)\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt's 2020, I was preparing some new bombs\nAnd making sure that my competition gon' put a noose on (Woo)\nMy aggression ain't really a subtle nuance\nI been in the game ten years, how can I do wrong? (Hey)\nWho's on what I'm on? I'm savage as usual\nI'm back in the booth, I have rappers to poop on (Yeah)\nNow there just ain't many plans I can move on\nAll because someone ate bat soup in Wuhan (What?)\nWell shit, that's what I heard\nI don't know what it was mixed with (I don't know)\nBut for someone to jeopardize everyone's life\nMan, it must have been fucking delicious (For real)\nThis shit is fucking ridiculous\nCan't be with my son or my siblings, the government trippin'\nMy pussy appointments with dozens of bitches are cancelled\nNow guess what I'm tuggin' my dick with? (What?)\n\"My right hand\", (Ooh)\nWhen I get a tingle inside of my penis, I'm like, \"Hi, my friend\" (Hi)\nAnd you know the lotion is sitting on, \"My nightstand\" (Hey)\nAnd when I finish my business, I go to \"Ni-night land\"\nAnd now I gotta take a weapon gettin' groceries (Yeah)\nHopefully motherfuckers know to back away forty feet\nDon't be jokingly mingling if you happen to notice me (No)\nI ain't fuckin' with none of you niggas 'til the 'Rona leave (Ugh)\n[Chorus]\nGet back (Hey)\nMove back, step back\nY'all better not touch me, ayy\nGet back (Come on)\nMove back, step back\nY'all better not touch me (Ugh)\nI done been told y'all niggas, back up (Move)\nYou don't wanna see me call backup (No)\nSo get back (Hey)\nMove back, step back\nY'all better not touch me\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe all at home, we campin' out (Fuck this)\nI notice everybody made a TikTok, oh, we dancin' now (Yah)\nAnd I see about four, five, six hundred new hoes made a OnlyFans account\nGet your money girl, better get your dough (Yeah, flash them titties one time)\nThis ain't funny girl, you finna be broke (You don't wanna be a broke bitch)\nSomebody told me it was the 5G towers\nAnd everybody's immunity spiraling downward\nAnd if it's true, fight the power, the time is now\nI gotta divide the crowd from the mindless cowards\nI know y'all love when I recite some foul words\nEspecially during the COVID-19 outburst\nAnd I got nothing better to do\nEvidence proves, I been spending hours live on IG, wowzers\nWait, hold up, wait, that's strange\nI sent a text, why you ignoring me? (You ignoring me)\nHmm, I know you got time to reply\nBitch, don't even lie, 'cause you in the quarantine\nYeah, I know how you do (Yeah)\nYou with your boo (Yeah)\nYou treatin' my feelings so morbidly\nAfter this song drop, bitch, I'm blocking you\nDon't be surprised when you text and it's going green (Ha!)\nHow do we deal with a worldwide corruption?\nI don't know if the media is hyping up shit\nLook at the situation our life is stuck in\nI got no toilet paper to wipe my butt with (Ugh)\nWhoever did this is on Hopsin's shit list\nGod forbid, the world get's apocalyptic\nWell it is soon, look at all the odds against it\nSo don't touch me without my permission (Ugh)\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nGet back (Hey)\nMove back, step back\nY'all better not touch me, ayy\nGet back (Come on)\nMove back, step back\nY'all better not touch me (Ugh)\nI done been told y'all niggas, back up (Move)\nYou don't wanna see me call backup (No)\nSo get back (Hey)\nMove back, step back\nY'all better not touch me (Move)21Embed"

Trust me I'm right\nGo to the motherfucking gym and lose the gut and you're fine\nYou might also like[Hook]\nMama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen\nMama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen\nI be banging on the pans in the kitchen\nSo mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen\nMama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen\nMama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen\nI be banging on the pans in the kitchen\nSo mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen\n\nI like playing with the pans in the kitchen mama\nYou gon' let me play with the pans in the kitchen mama\nDon't care what you say about the pans in the kitchen mama\nI'ma prove that I'm the man in the kitchen mama!\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm Marcus and yes I am stupid\nThought I was a smart kid? Guess again, stupid\nI'm a special ed student\nGive me a couple of bars and let the man prove it\n'Cause there's evidence to it\nI never knew it, but the rest of my class knew it\nThey must've thought I'd never remember the past to it\nFuck school, man, I never could pass through it\nI never be that student that headed to class who gets an A\nUp on his report card, a nice kid who's so smart\nSeem like when they threw me in special ed It got more hard\nEvery year the cycle repeats over again\nMy friends graduate and I'm way older then them\nThen they come to me, nice mugging me, making fun of me\nWhat do these ugly motherfuckers be thinking when they fuck with me?\nThey lucky I don't suddenly go and become something other than me\nLike a fucking psycho, then what's it gonna be?\n[Hook]\nMama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen\nMama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen\nI be banging on the pans in the kitchen\nSo mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen\nMama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen\nMama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen\nI be banging on the pans in the kitchen\nSo mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen\n\nI like playing with the pans in the kitchen mama\nYou gon' let me play with the pans in the kitchen mama\nDon't care what you say about the pans in the kitchen mama\nI'ma prove that I'm the man in the kitchen mama!\n(Man in the kitchen mama....)7Embed"

She eventually tries to get through to him through the rest of FV.\n\nOn the commentary for this track, Hopsin stated that Ramona was not the story of one girl but many obsessed groupies that tried to sleep with him. Hopsin condensed all of these girls and their actions to one girl."

Hopsin condensed all of these girls and their actions to one girl."

    "plain": "On \u201cAlone With Me\u201d Hopsin has an honest conversation with himself and reflects back on his career, love life, family and relationships.\n\nTheme of suicide is present throughout the whole song and Hopsin uses it as a metaphor to \u201ckill-off\u201d a previous version of himself and his lifestyle, which can be seen at the end of the music video where Hopsin pulls the pin out of grenade and hands it to the previous version of himself.\n\nThe song was announced on March 18 2021, when Hopsin posted a snippet of the song on his Instagram saying:\n\nNew video dropping this Monday at 9am pacific! This is probably my favorite video I\u2019ve ever done, by far. You\u2019re gonna like this one.\n\nThe day before the song\u2019s release he posted again saying that he\u2019s dropping \u201ca crazy song and an even crazier video\u201d."

This is probably my favorite video I\u2019ve ever done, by far. You\u2019re gonna like this one.\n\nThe day before the song\u2019s release he posted again saying that he\u2019s dropping \u201ca crazy song and an even crazier video\u201d."

Talk to me, how you livin' G?\nYou look so confused right now, do you remember me?\n'Cause I've been with you since a teen, fuckin' you up mentally\nI love it (I do) stayin' inside your head, where the rent is free\nI'm just here to make sure you keep all your crazy tendencies\nLook at yourself in disbelief, struggle with your identity\nStuck in depression until you diagnosed with it clinically\nHow's your love life? It's still a triflin' mess?\nNigga you thirty-five, you haven't found a wifey yet?\nI mean, if I was you would I be stressed? Y-E-S\nI guess a mail-order bride is nice, it might be best\nSo, how did you manage to get rich, yet be so empty?\nConstantly stuck in a deep old frenzy\nMaybe your ego ain't eco-friendly, bro you got a life that we don't envy\nAnd I bet suicide must be so tempting, do it\n[Chorus]\nWait, hold up (Damn) Fuck's wrong with me?\nI can't leave me alone with me\nI'm like, \"Who is this nigga and why do I fear him?\"\nIt couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror\nWait, hold up (Shit) It's got control of me\nI don't know who I'm supposed to be\nI'm like, \"Who is this nigga and why do I fear him?\"\nIt couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo, how's the rap life? Do people enjoy your music?\nOr you still spittin' that bullshit to destroy the youth with?\nBe honest, you live in the shadow of Joyner Lucas (Oh-oh)\nYou jealous? I know that you are, my point is proven\nFuck happened to you? You was spittin' so cold\nYou was the Ill Mind of Hopsin, on the list with the GOATs\nThen you fell off, you should've took a different approach (Aw)\nI hate to say it, but you'll never be like Kendrick or Cole, nigga\nIt's fucked up, that isn't fair, Marcus\nI'm hopin' that God will answer your prayers, Marcus\nBut even if he does the chances are rare that you'll\nHave hands in the air headlinin' Madison Square Garden\nNigga put the mic' down, don't you fight this fight\n'Cause you the corny rapper only weird white kids like\nSo, every time the blogs post you, the comments gon' roast you\nI would rather be dead than be caught livin' in your shoes\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWait, hold up (I'm trippin') The fuck's wrong with me?\nI can't leave me alone with me\nI'm like, \"Who is this nigga and why do I fear him?\"\nIt couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror\nWait, hold up (Please stop) It's got control of me\nI don't know who I'm supposed to be\nI'm like, \"Who is this nigga and why do I fear him?\"\nIt couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror\n\n[Verse 3]\nAight, I got an idea, I'll tell you how it works\nIt's gonna sound a little outrageous, but hear me out first\nYou turn your phone off for two weeks and start an outburst\nOf worried family members, which leads to a local town search\nBut when they find you, you dead inside of your crib (Perfect)\nWith a letter that says goodbye to your kid\nBut you don't get to see him anyway 'cause your ex is wildin' and shit\nSo, in his little head, it's like you already died, it's a trip\nWhile you reside in Heaven or Hell, whichever side that it is\nYour baby mom's'll regret the shit she never tried to get fixed\nIf you're alive, chances are she'll never try to repent\nI'm just tryna show you ways to exercise your revenge\nAll you want is love, right? Well, you gon' have to get some balls\nShoot your fuckin' brains out until they splat against the walls\nI mean it has to hit the blogs and all your fans'll get involved\nAnd you'll be missed, 'cause people don't know what they have until it's lost\n[Bridge]\nHug your dad and kiss your mom before this transition is done\nInto the new life, your current one is trash, it isn't fun\nYeah, everybody got problems and we all fightin' this big war\nBut your problems are different, you got nothin' to live for\n\n[Chorus]\nWait, hold up (Oh no) The fuck's wrong with me?\nI can't leave me alone with me\nI'm like, \"Who is this nigga and why do I fear him?\"\nIt couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror\nWait, hold up (Please stop) It's got control of me\nI don't know who I'm supposed to be\nI'm like, \"Who is this nigga and why do I fear him?\"\nIt couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror\n\n[Outro: Sadhguru]\nWhat I'm thinking, what you're thinking is not the important thing\nWe're alive right now, that is the important thing\nIt is important that you focus on this fundamental sense of aliveness within you\nAnd then you'll see there's a natural distance between you and your thought process\nOnce you create a little space between you and your mind, between you and your body, this is the end of suffering\nDon't identify any thought as negative, because it's just a thought Who told you it's negative? It's just a thought, you're making it up\nMaybe you like it, what's the problem?\nIf you understand it's just a thought, it has no power\nIf you think it's a reality, then it destroys you18Embed"

Every day is a rerun\nTechnology's advanced, as people how far have we come?\nYeah, I can see that time's grown, but still I'm mind blown\n'Cause everybody's mind is stuck inside they iPhone\nThey always textin' and postin' statuses hourly\nBut in reality, there's no sign of a personality\nIt's cowardly, we shielded like we scared to get some allergies\nThe human being is what we don't know how to be\nAnd honestly these issues really suck to know\nBut I refuse to sit and let the trouble grow, so God, show me where the fuck to go\nYou might also like[Hook]\nI can't stand humans, I hate humans, but I'm a human\n(I'm only human)\nOne monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it, humans are so stupid\nDon't bring your bull shit around me (Fuckin' human)\nThe problem is killin' my mind, God, give me a sign\nMaybe I'm trippin', tell me this life is worth livin'\n\n[Verse 3]\nHow can a man with power feel there's no responsibility?\nThese rappers blowin' up, but through my eyes they not as real to me\nThey constantly conceal the beast, but never try to heal the streets\nTeachin' girls to be a slut, but never make 'em feel unique\nHow can we feel fine this way? Open up your minds today\nThe matrix got you young, owin' a debt you'll spend your life to pay\nStressed out, assumin' that you'll be more happy inside your grave\nDon't tell me about no fuckin' struggle then, nigga, 'cause I know pain\nTo the point where I felt like life was shit\nGrowin' up as a kid with both parents who got no funds to ever provide you with\nShit is just stuck repeatin', the world is tough to be in\nMunchin' on fast food, don't even know what the fuck I'm eatin'\nAmerica, I gave it my all\nStill you guys arrested me for bein' black and standin' on a sidewalk\nIt doesn't matter if I'm breakin' laws or bein' harmless\nI'm automatically hated by cops 'cause my dark skin\nGod was my smartest option\nMy soul is mine, y'all ain't gon' bargain off it\n'Cause if you do that means the darkness profits\nThe sky is where I got my heart adopted\nMan, if we all just took the time to think I swear it won't be hard to stop this\nBut y'all assume that I'm just startin' nonsense\nBut I promise y'all the fuckin' world is gon' remember Marcus Hopson\nThere's consequences for enlightenment\nBut if I have to hide the truth to live then I'mma die just like my idols did\n[Hook]\nI can't stand humans, I hate humans, but I'm a human\n(I'm only human)\nOne monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it, humans are so stupid\nDon't bring your bull shit around me (Fuckin' human)\nThe problem is killin' my mind, God, give me a sign\nMaybe I'm trippin', tell me this life is worth livin'16Embed"

Wicked frontside flips\nOnly one try bitches want to touch my dick\nThe homie Manny know a school with a spot so proper\nSo we go hop the gate and hope the cops don't spot us\nWe mad and fucking senseless, waxing up the benches\nGet the cameras out because we stacking up the tricks\nBitch, kickflip backtail was on my hit-list\nUntil this nigga P-Rod came and did the shit switch\nSaw a handrail and figured I could bust on it\nTried to boardslide and hit my fucking nuts on it\nStupid homies hyped me up look at my ass now\n'Bout to pass out, man I'm only skating flat ground\nSome days I feel like I suck and never try stuff\nUntil I watch a skate video and get hyped up\nYou phony niggas tryna rap, better pipe down\nThis shit isn't just a trend homie it's a lifestyle\n\n[Hook]\nI be nollie tre flippin' on your block straight cruising\nTre tre flippin' on your block straight cruising\nNollie tre flippin on your block straight cruising\nTre Tre flippin' on your block straight cruising\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nNow wait just a minute trick, yo this kid is sick\nHow the fuck this nigga doing tres with the ninja kick?\nI still got em fresher than a loaf of bread\nIf you witness one you'll probably throw your board away and just go home instead\nBlazing up the hubba on this skating little suckers\nThey ain't brave enough so they say I'm a crazy motherfucker\nYes, best believe I'm that raw, you don't have to ask dog\nI been doing this since you were semen in your dad's balls\nSo much pop you would think I'm bout to blast off\nSo fucking high when I land I crack the asphalt\nG'd up shoes the color of cherry kool-aid\nHat back, with no belt in my pants, just a shoe lace\nSkating legends mean mugging yo, when will these niggas learn?\nIt's been 10 minutes and I still can't seem to get a turn\nIf I never go pro fuck it yo, I ain't tripping\nLong as I look fly as fuck when I be nollie tre flipping\n\n[Hook]\nI be nollie tre flippin' on your block straight cruising\nTre tre flippin' on your block straight cruising\nNollie tre flippin on your block straight cruising\nTre Tre flippin' on your block straight cruising18Embed"

(blood)\n\n[Hook]\nNow see, I got a strange urge\nAnd I feel like creepin' up on a stranger\nI want your blood\nBlood, blood, blood, blood\nI want your blood\nBlood, blood, blood, blood\nGive me your blood\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nBeat niggas till they have concussions (woah)\nRape wives and then laugh at husbands (woah)\nAnd if you down with the mass destruction (what)\nToast to it with a glass of blood then (blood)\nPray to God for a night to start\nI'm a psycho nigga finna top the charts\nBeing shot with darts till it stops your heart\nAnd chopped apart and thrown up in a shopping cart\nAnd pushed off a cliff, there's no alternate\nEnding that involved with this, it's your fault I'm pissed\nYou're gonna suffer the consequences\nYou can not prevent this shit, I promise it, come on (blood)\nPretty clear that my brain's not there\nI be looking for it when I shave my hair\nBlack is the color that I paint my lair\nAnd the way I break niggas everyday is not fair\nIt's all because of the rage I bare\nSee I'm down for whatever, just say \"I dare\"\nMy nut sack is the biggest so you niggas gonna have to murder me if you wanna take my pair (blood)\n\n[Hook]\nNow see, I got a strange urge\nAnd I feel like creepin' up on a stranger\nI want your blood\nBlood, blood, blood, blood\nI want your blood\nBlood, blood, blood, blood\nGive me your blood\n[Verse 4]\nYou don't like me? Tune it out\nI'm livin' life on the foolish route\nWhen I hit the kitchen, I butcher niggas until they drain slowly, but only when the moon is out\nI get this way when my mood is down\nSome even think that I'm rude and foul\nOut of all the lovely children my mother gave birth to, I was the stupid child (blood)\nBack in the day, when I was in elementary, I would chisel a pencil until it sharp as fuck\nLeavin' the bullies laid out, on the playground\nWhen they came round, yell \"fuck\" if you're raw as nuts, come on (fuck)\nThe sight of blood is so marvellous, stab a nigga in his stomach till you scar the gut\nHit 'em in the spine until you paralyze him and fill him with lighter fluid and go ahead and spark him up\nAnd then abracadabra, am I missing brain cells? That doesn't matter\nMakin' you scream makes me a happier rapper\nYou don't want trouble then your ass better back up\nFast little bastard (blood)\nI was born as a natural hazard, I turn lives into massive disasters\nLook over your shoulder when I'm in the area\nYou might get hit in the cranium with the back of a hammer (blood)\n\n[Hook]\nNow see, I got a strange urge\nAnd I feel like creepin' up on a stranger\nI want your blood\nBlood, blood, blood, blood\nI want your blood\nBlood, blood, blood, blood\nGive me your blood7Embed"

Think before attacking me\nI know I'm quick to get outta line like I have to pee\nIt's obvious that I got your heart thumping\nI may look like a fucking idiot, but I promise I'm far from it\n[Hook]\nA year ago I wasn't all that\nNow all off a sudden bitches all on my ballsack\nAm I your best friend? What? Heck no\nYou can be a fan of all of my songs, nigga but, just don't\nRide my dick, no, don't ride my dick\nYes, don't ride my dick, no, don't ride my dick\n[Verse 2]\nCheck me out\nI talk shit and whip beats, I'm a true MC\nOnly one who tells me what to do is me\nTake a close look at FV and what it grew to be\nHoppa, Dizzy, me and three Z has made the group complete\nMy shit is past basic, in my eyes I feel I have made it\nCame a long way from my mom and dad's basement\nWhen I do shows now the women strip me half naked\nMy motherfucking bad language got my ass famous\nNow labels thinking about signing me (yes)\nMTV has got they eye on me (yes)\nSkubbedy dubbedy wow, this is irony\nI still ain't giving a fuck\nSo if I hurt your feelings tell it to your diary\nNigga, I'm so beast, rhyming over cold beats\nFinally shining without the diamonds and gold teeth\nThe higher empire tryna bring fire in on me\nSo I keep my guards up, when I'm tired I don't sleep\nYou might also like[Hook]\nA year ago I wasn't all that\nNow all off a sudden bitches all on my ballsack\nAm I your best friend? What? Heck no\nYou can be a fan of all of my songs, nigga but, just don't\nRide my dick, no, don't ride my dick\nYes, don't ride my dick, no, don't ride my dick\n\n[Verse 3]\nI know there's whole lot of niggas who wonder why I keep dissin'\nI ain't trippin', just listen, I'm on a discrete mission\nRappers speaking on drugs, money and deceive women for a check\nWhile they boss grillin', sittin' in their seat spinnin'\nThat's like the foulest crime\nSomewhere down the line I was bound to rise\nTo make a difference, and now it's time\nI know you rappers is about a dime\nBut it\u2019s hard for me to live when you corrupting minds I\u2019m surrounded by\nI ain't the nigga you go outshine\nTruth is, you only go in when I'm coming outside\nFuck your road, turning down mine\nWhen you greet me get on your knees and open your mouth wide\nFor the record I ain't the type to share\nIf you a rapper tainting my image, then war is what I might declare\nJust cause I'm buzzing off the white contacts\nDon't mean you should take your ass to Hot Topic to buy a pair\n[Hook]\nA year ago I wasn't all that\nNow all off a sudden bitches all on my ballsack\nAm I your best friend? What? Heck no\nYou can be a fan of all of my songs, nigga but, just don't\nRide my dick, no, don't ride my dick\nYes, don't ride my dick, no, don't ride my dick\n\n[Outro]2Embed"

A snobby and deadly poet\nSo nigga, put down the pen 'cause I prolly already wrote it\nI'm the nigga that Hollywood barely noticed\nFor pullin' cards, it's easy as sockin' on Gary Coleman\nHow did you get a deal without havin' no type of talent?\nThe shit you write is invalid, you gettin' your mic impounded\nI'm livin' in a dump, you livin' life in a palace\nDinin' with Caesar salads, man, how do you guys allow it?\nYo, you weak niggas in the limelight trippin' (Yah)\nBut I won't let you slide like friction (Nah)\nNot tryna be your buddy in this rap shit, I like dissin' (Ha)\nSo you can kiss my ass and watch them white eyes glisten (C'mon)\nYa'll nigga's be regulatin' the area\nHesitatin' to, scared of some defamation of character (You know)\nI got it locked, no separatin' the barriers\nMedicate your hysteria, heaven's waitin' to carry ya\n[Hook]\nMy hot 16's be on that ill shi (Uh-huh)\nYour hot 16's still with the children (Uh-huh)\nBaby, Hopsin is in the building (You know)\nWe gon' have one hell of a time (Right now)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm a pro but I kick it with the beginners\nThat what I whip up for dinner, it's been up on my agenda\nI came and left, but now I'm finna re-enter\nShiver me timbers, how the fuck can a nigga be realer?\nI don't know but my flow is so cold (Mr. Oh No!)\nAt your door, I'm ready fo' war\nWhen you was flossin' on me, tryna swerve in your Hummer\nI was plottin' way bigger, nigga, word to your mother\nMy verses are butter, I emerged from the gutter\nTo step up inside the booth and then work, motherfuckers\nI'm hungry as all of the roaches that lurk in my cupboards\nYou should be duckin', runnin' to send the word to the others\nI'm a fuckin' nightmare and your worst hell\nAnd I'm leavin' niggas stuck behind the bars, they don't deserve bail\nYou see wackness doesn't sit on my nerves well\nYou couldn't bust with a dick full of sperm cells\n\n[Hook]\nMy hot 16's be on that ill shi (Uh-huh)\nYour hot 16's still with the children (Uh-huh)\nBaby, Hopsin is in the building (You know)\nWe gon' have one hell of a time (Right now)\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nYou see, I'm lyrically bashin' up on your feelings\nI'm bad and I don't conceal it, this dragon is known for killin'\nThat's the reason I'm baggin' these hoes and grillin'\nMy madness is so appealin' and swagger is on a billion\nAside from all of the provocative hellishness\nI'm somewhat underground but got the commercial elements\nAccording to Ruthless Records, it wasn't evident\nSo I'mma 9/11 the label, bitches, to hell with it\nI'm that crazy nigga, you can't be iller\nI'll pick your fuckin' mom up in an 18-wheeler\nYeah, I'll hit it, but if she don't wanna pay me scrilla\nI'll let a Rottweiler fuck her till the rabies kill her\nMy hobbies are rappin' vicious, slappin' bitches\nGrabbin' digits, and I occasionally laugh at midgets\nI'm hardly sane and half-horrific with a dab of mischief\nNever rap no shit if I haven't lived it, it's that specific\n\n[Hook]\nMy hot 16's be on that ill shi (Uh-huh)\nYour hot 16's still with the children (Uh-huh)\nBaby, Hopsin is in the building (You know)\nWe gon' have one hell of a time (Right now)\n\n[Outro]\nWelcome to Raw\nWelcome to Raw\nWelcome to Raw\nWelcome to Raw\nWelcome to Raw\nWe gone have one hell of a time (Right now)3Embed"

No hoes hopping inside my ride\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a beam just like the shining sun\nBut I'd be a fool if I say you're the one\nAnd I'd be the water that's raining down on the land\nBut I won't be your man\nYou see I got other plans\nYou know what you know what\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nEvery girl I meet, always talking bout \"I don't even wanna know Hopsin, ew\nYeah, he got some skills but every time he put them eyes in it look like he popped some pills\nI just wanna know Marcus, he's a sweet little innocent boy\nOh god I'd date him with no prob\nAnd if he wanted to I'll let him beat the pussy with no condom\"\nBitch, what's your problem? You expect me to be optim -mistic, for the mischief you bring your senseless bitch you out of\nYour mind I know you like the fact I'm so bad when I spit up on the track\nBlack and I rap with a little bit of swag and happen to have a little money in the back\nWhat the fuck do you got that'll impress me so I can feel half of the magic?\nA loose vaginal passage, uh uh bitch put that back in the package\nI feel so sick and lonely, I want a real girl that will get to know me\nNo charcoal breath who be hitting a stogie and not one that'll say shit to blow me\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a beam just like the shining sun\nBut I'd be a fool if I say you're the one\nAnd I'd be the water that's raining down on the land\nBut I won't be your man\nYou see I got other plans\nYou know what you know what\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\n[Verse 3]\nI like nature, ah you too? Wow, we got so much in common boo\nDon't be assuming that I'm going to love you because if you do I'll cut you out of my life I promise you\nI'm down to earth and I'm an honest dude\nYou barely be giving me any homage dues\nI would definitely regret it and probably get a big headache if I was stupid and got with you\nHow many guys have you let bone you? (Uhhh?) Let me guess, you don't have no clue huh?\nCould've been 5, could have been 10, could have been a million nigga's that hopped on you huh?\nI ain't trying to be another one on the list, that'll make me a true son of a bitch\nYup I know how you work, you ain't nothing but a flirt baby girl that's one of the risks\nBest believe that I'ma pass on that, ain't got time for no asshole acts\nYou say you a good girl that's no fact, can't roll smooth 'cause your axles cracked\nYou can't find a good man that's so sad, I think it's because you act so wack\nSo don't be trying to blame the world for your nonsense bitch I'll fuck around a smack yo ass\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a beam just like the shining sun\nBut I'd be a fool if I say you're the one\nAnd I'd be the water that's raining down on the land\nBut I won't be your man\nYou see I got other plans\nYou know what you know what\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\n\n[Outro]\nBaby, maybe we can meet up tomorrow and we can give it one more try\nBut in the meantime I'ma have to say goodbye baby 'cause right now you're not my type\nNow listen, I'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama4Embed"

What? Will you be my baby daddy\nAnd be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!\nWill you watch SpongeBob with him\nAnd then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!\nEven though I got stretch marks\nWould you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!\nShit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows\nPlease? No! Please? No!\n[Verse 1]\nHold up, throw me the mic, I got a flow to recite\nYou got a baby by a nigga that you don't even like\nA broke nigga who thuggish, always be talkin' rubbish\nSteady be causing ruckus, all because you were sluttish\nJesus, I can't believe this, freak shit!\nThat's the same motherfucker that you had cheated on me with! (What?!)\nI knew this would happen without a question\nBut you said, \"I never have sex without protection\"\nBitch please, you left me flowing down shits creek\nYou sex driven like a big freak\nPlus our relationship has been breached, you took a big leap\nAnd rumor has it you sucked his dick then kissed me\nAnd now I'm s'pose to be the father and the mental guide\nLike, \"Sure, I'll take care of the little guy\"\nShit, you ain't puttin' me through the stress\nI put your baby in a pillow case and beat it to death, bitch\n\n[Chorus]\nMarcus? What? Will you be my baby daddy\nAnd be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!\nWill you watch SpongeBob with him\nAnd then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!\nEven though I got stretch marks\nWould you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!\nShit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows\nPlease? No! Please? No!\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nI'm far from a fuckin' life saver\nNot you're friendly neighbor, but yet you called me during your labor\nIt's not my issue, take me off the menu\nI'm not the one who put the motherfucker in you\nI'm not a mean guy, hate to sound that foul\nBut I don't give a fuck about that child (You damn right)\nSee you chose him, then he fucked you, tag, you\u2019re it\nToo bad his dick didn't have any insurance\nYou knew that he was just a lame nigga prior to it\nNow your ass hittin' me up thinking I would do it\nHoping we gonna spark it off like some lighter fluid\nThat's kinda stupid, face the facts, bitch, your life is ruined\nAnd don't be callin' me like, \"My life's a crazy blur\nRashad don't take care of the baby and makes me hurt\nI wish that me and you could go back to the way we were\"\nShit we can, just get rid of the baby first\n\n[Chorus]\nMarcus? What? Will you be my baby daddy\nAnd be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!\nWill you watch SpongeBob with him\nAnd then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!\nEven though I got stretch marks\nWould you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!\nShit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows\nPlease? No! Please? No!\n[Bridge]\nNow I won't be your baby's daddy, I'm not the one\nBut you can still give me some head and maybe swallow some cum\nAnd if you want it, then I can deliver quite clean\nBut don't ever send the baby to find me\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo\nDo you remember when I told you I would love you forever\nAnd broke up with my girlfriend Heather\nKicked her to the curb, and then I got with you thinkin' that you are better\nAnd found out you were a heart shredder\nYeah, I felt really stupid after that\nBecame the nigga that my crew was laughin' at, I was foolish, that's a fact\n(Yup) So this is karma, you been on my shit list\nSo ha ha ha ha, that's what you get, bitch\n\n[Chorus]\nMarcus? What? Will you be my baby daddy\nAnd be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!\nWill you watch SpongeBob with him\nAnd then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!\nEven though I got stretch marks\nWould you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!\nShit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows\nPlease? No! Please? No!\n\n[Outro]\nHey, that's life\nYou fuck me over\nHe fucked you, you got pregnant\nNow you're fucked\nYou had me\nYou had me, that's the funny thing about it\nAnd you blew it\nHa ha ha7Embed"

If you only knew what I knew, if you only knew what I could do. If you could only see what I could see you would probably stop bothering me\n\n[Verse 1: Hopsin]\nYeah\nI independently started this shit, marketing hits\nStarving for chips, no gasoline to start off the whip\nFelt like the only nigga labels wasn't bargaining with\nMy heart has been ripped, I stuck with it as hard as it gets\nThese producers would always blow me off\nNow that I'm blowing up, they don't recall\nTalking about \"Yo, you my homie, dawg\" (My nigga)\nOh, now you wanna hop on the Hop train\nKnowing damn well since '04 I had hot flames (The fuck outta here)\nMy real buddies was mainly the worst\nHating to shoot my videos without me paying them first\nSo I slide 'em 100 bucks to watch 'em bitch on how it ain't enough (Man)\nThat money got my cell, internet and cable cut!\nA real homie would've gave a fuck and not expect to pay upfront\nThen get the money later when I'm making some\nNobody saw the bigger picture except me\nThey neglect me, only thing that protects me is FV (Come on)\n[Chorus: Chelsea Hopson & Hopsin]\nYou don't always have to stick by my side\nJust make sure you remember me when I die\nI am raw, I am raw\nJust to let you niggas know\nBitch I am raw, I am raw\nDon't forget me when I'm gone\nBitch I am raw\n\n[Verse 2: SwizZz]\nI was a high school grad preparing to go to college\nAn enthusiastic freshman, major in Economics\nI didn't have a clue what to expect to be honest\nBanging beats in my dorm, streaming Pornhub constant\nI figured I could make it out in four years tops\nStudy religiously and graduate, apply for a job\nThe rap thing was secondary, I was putting it off\nCalling it quits, assuming I had better chances playing ball (Yep)\nMy third year came and suddenly that changed\nI couldn't bear watching my mom at home suffering pain\nTryna fight off the strain of only having half a stomach\nPlus a handicap back from a surgery that helped nothing!\nSo I returned to the valley and called the homie\nHop was on Ruthless getting shelved like a trophy\nI told him how I left my life in the OC\nAnd we concluded that we could both use FV\nYou might also like[Chorus: Chelsea Hopson & Hopsin]\nYou don't always have to stick by my side\nJust make sure you remember me when I die\nI am raw, I am raw\nJust to let you niggas know\nBitch I am raw, I am raw\nDon't forget me when I'm gone\nBitch I am raw\n\n[Verse 3: Hopsin]\nThis was written for niggas who wouldn't give me dap\nNiggas who told me that I had sissy rap\nThis was written for all the bitches I used to called who never hit me back\nUntil they heard the word I was buzzing, c'mon don't give me that (Shit)\nYou backed out, now you tryna roll with my clique?\nWhere the fuck were you when my signing bonus was spent?\nWhere the fuck were you when I got the notice for rent\nSaying I was getting evicted and I was hopeless as shit?\nSee I keep some names handy and you got thrown on the list\nThat's how you know that I'm pissed, I got you, don't even trip\n'Cause I'm rude over the nicest beats, you had to go ignite the heat\nYou might agree to beef, but yo I'm not the type you'd like to meet\nLife's indeed a journey that I have yet to finish\nHopefully my career's something that will be epidemic\nYou'll always know that it's Hopsin the way I wreck a sentence\nRealness, I represent it, raw, I'm the definition\n[Chorus: Chelsea Hopson & Hopsin]\nYou don't always have to stick by my side\nJust make sure you remember me when I die\nI am raw, I am raw\nJust to let you niggas know\nBitch I am raw, I am raw\nDon't forget me when I'm gone\nBitch I am raw4Embed"

Take a second listen to my tunes\nYou niggas better quit I advise you\nYou never go in like a non-erected dick in a dry cooch\n\n[Verse 3 : Dizzy Wright]\nRappers get nervous when they see me in the picture\nThey know the consequences of me becoming that nigga\nFunk Volume representa leaving niggas in a maze,\nYou can't get to Hop if I'm playing security at the gate\nUh, It's crazy cuz' I'm in and out The Veg\nI see a lack of preparation, but I ain't giving out no breaks\nI'm giving out these hands, so I'm letting you know in advance\nIf you try to step to the plate I'll let my lyrics break your face\nI, went from Soul Searchin' to Smoke Out, now I'm overseas and these shows are still sold out\nYou should be ashamed if you thinkin' I'm bout' to hold out, I'm just coming from the city where I had to kick the do' down\nUh, a flat-top til' my hair is long, Try to clown and I'mma have to hang you with this herringbone\nThe south fuck with us cuz nigga we put Jarren on, Carry on, We just tryna get our money very long\nYa, and it's working quite nicely, get your wifey, too much time she might like me\nThe new version of DJ Quik in the 90's, my rhythmalism got these wack niggas tryna find me\nIt's crazy I went from nothing to something, said I was going global now I'm rapping out in London\nI'm coming, I've been a savage heading for your demographic, fuck a punchline I make instant classics niggaYou might also like3Embed"

What it do? What's up? What it do?\nYou blowin' all your money on the hoes and the cars bro\nIt's all dope, but we all know\n(Nigga I'm too lowkey for that)\n[Verse 1]\nI'll admit my last few years have been kinda rusty\nHave I been beatin' myself up? In my mind I must be\nI slowed down, watchin' my peers as they rise above me\n'Cause rap's a leap of faith except nobody ties the bungee\nThese times are ugly\nI'm close to my midlife, the crisis hunts me\nCalm on the surface but inside I'm grumpy\nIf I was comfy, I'd say \"fuck rap\" because life is complete\nSurprise I'm hungry, rappers lookin' like fries and lunch meat\nDamn you got the hoes, you got a grill, you makin' mills huh (Huh)\nWhen you be flexin' you lookin' so icy that I get the chills son (Huh)\nI seen you pull up in your whip and you stopped\nBut somehow the wheels spun (Damn!)\nWho is the plug for the drugs? Tell me where you get the pills from\nI heard you came from the real slums\nWhat the fuck you gon' do when your deal's done?\nNigga the day that you fizzle out will come\nIf you think it ain't comin' you're real dumb\nThat ain't a bag you made off your talent\nThat is a label allowance\nAnd we gon' see in the end if you really could pay off the balance\nBitch!\n\n[Chorus]\n(I'm too lowkey for that)\nNiggas on the bad slope, finna crash woah\nTryna show the hoes the cash flow\n(Nigga I'm too lowkey for that)\nMy foot is on the gas though\nGot my hat low, still an asshole, yeah ho\n(I'm not too lowkey for that)\nNigga I just do what it does\nWhat's up? What it do? What's up? What it do?\nYou blowin' all your money on the hoes and the cars bro\nIt's all dope, but we all know\n(Nigga I'm too lowkey for that)\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nI could care less about expensive gold chains\nI'm gettin' mo' praise from spittin' propane\nBitch this is no game\nI don't fuck with hoes who hang with rappers and want fame\nFuck the swaggy shit, now I'm livin' like it's the old days\nSo pack your bags, you had your chance, this might be the\nAvalanche that wipes it up\nI'm back to rockin' baggy pants and wife beaters\nBitch your time is up\nThis my master plan and lightning struck\nDon't get caught in fires that my ashy hands is writin' up\nBeen had the fuckin' game on lock\nBeen had my pesos copped\nBeen plottin' deeply tryna take yo spot\nI can't erase those thoughts\nMy drive is somethin' that these fakes don't got\nTheir vision blurry tryna chase those thots\nYou tryna do it independent but you ain't no Hop\nThe indie valedictorian, bitch, my grades don't drop\nQuit tryna move me\nBeast mode is where my mind is usually\nY'all focused on Louis Vuitton and Gucci, I told you\u2014\n\n[Chorus]\n(I'm too lowkey for that)\nNiggas on the bad slope, finna crash woah\nTryna show the hoes the cash flow\n(Nigga I'm too lowkey for that)\nMy foot is on the gas though\nGot my hat low, still an asshole, yeah ho\n(I'm not too lowkey for that)\nNigga I just do what it does\nWhat's up?

Got my ear to the streets\nAnd I notice everybody dropping shit, I feel left out\n(Is that right?) If you in it for the cheese\nThis is real trap music, yeah, you go be a dead mouse\n(Is that right?) You on a oneway street\nEither collide or turn it around, that'd be your best route\nListen, y'all need to stop with the dissing\nNo one pays attention, so quit with the chitchat\nListen, y'all niggas steadily fishing\nYou riding me hard and my girl want my dick back\nListen, these niggas play like it's cool\nAnd then run their mouth soon as I'm leaving, why is that?\nListen, I've been touring off an album\nI ain't even dropped, you pro'ly think I rigged that (Nice)\nI'm the plate, nigga, you just the dish rack\nThe whole Ill Mind series, I done did that\nNiggas double taking, getting whiplash\nHow you tryna school me when I skip class\nConfrontation with you is just quick cash\nWhat the fuck you gon' do when your ship crash?\nI got the juice, don't get caught in the splish splash\nWe don't fit in together, we mitch match\nI am the misfit that nobody likes\nI am colder than ice, I will hold up your life\nYou bigging you up, you were so overhyped\nYou were no good with mics, you'll be gone overnight\nI saw my window and I dove on it right\nPlus the flow is precise, I'm just rolling the dice\nYou claim that you got the shit on lock\nThinking you safe, but homie, I done broken it twice\nAlright\n[Chorus]\nAll around the fucking planet\nNiggas on my shit, dog\nWest side, east side, north side, south side\nBitches on my dick, dog\nSnatch yo' freak, I'm that nigga\nCash on fleek, I'm that nigga\nPast O.D., I'm that nigga\nAs for me, I'm that nigga\nAll around the fucking planet\nNiggas on my shit, dog\nWest side, east side, north side, south side\nBitches on my dick, dog\nSnatch yo' freak, I'm that nigga\nCash on fleek, I'm that nigga\nPast O.D., I'm that nigga\nAs for me, I'm that nigga\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook, got a brand new chick\nShe a law student working real hard out in Cape Town\n(Cape Town, Cape Town) I became ill\nWhen I hit the beat raw, it was ass up, facedown\n(Facedown, facedown) Homie, you ain't shit\nYou tryna shine, I'ma turn your sunlight into a gray cloud\n(Rain, rain) Had to hit you with a new flow\nSaying that I sound like Slim Shady during 8 Mile\nYou signed your life away to record labels\nWhile I'm signing big ol' voluptuous titties\nI run through the city, the ladies are comfortable with me\nThey're wet and I want to go swimming\nA wonderful feeling (Woo)\nI strike that pussy like a thunderbolt hitting (Woo, woo)\nLadies say \"Oh my God, papi\nIt's all in my hair now, your cum is so sticky\" (Yikes)\nAm I a sellout or prodigy?\nWord on the street is the question is suss\n(Suss) Niggas threw dirt on my name\nIt's ironic that they just got left in the dust\n(The dust) You got your head in the clouds?\nI am convinced that your head is just stuck\nHmm, don't make me go through my files\nAnd pull all of your dirty evidence up (Oh no)\nNiggas it's been on, my pen strong\nIf one shot fires I'm Kim Jong, so bitch, run\nI sent bombs like ISIS from Islam\nYou drenched on with a light mist of piss, son\nWho you know could get it like this? There is none\nRip your limbs, gone from a sick collision\nSee my nuts hang low, you can't miss the big ones\nI'm coming, nigga, here, tell your chick to sip some\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAll around the fucking planet\nNiggas on my shit, dog\nWest side, east side, north side, south side\nBitches on my dick, dog\nSnatch yo' freak, I'm that nigga\nCash on fleek, I'm that nigga\nPast O.D., I'm that nigga\nAs for me, I'm that nigga\nAll around the fucking planet\nNiggas on my shit, dog\nWest side, east side, north side, south side\nBitches on my dick, dog\nSnatch yo' freak, I'm that nigga\nCash on fleek, I'm that nigga\nPast O.D., I'm that nigga\nAs for me, I'm that nigga7Embed"

    "plain": "This is the 10th track on Hopsin\u2019s 5th studio album, No Shame. The song is about a woman, (most likely his ex girlfriend Alyce Madden) in which he talks about their relationship.\n\nThis song samples one of Hopsin\u2019s singles, \u201cDie This Way\u201d. It uses a pitch shifted version of a vocal sung by Joey Tee, the artist who also happens to be featured on the song \u201cPanorama City\u201d the 14th track on No Shame.\n\nMusic video for the song was released on February 20th, 2018. It was flagged as inappropriate by Youtube, which is a second song on No Shame that has been flagged, since Youtube deleted Hopsin\u2019s music video for the song \u201cHappy Ending\u201d.\nHopsin commented on the situation on his Instagram post:\n\nSo they flag my \u201cTell\u2019em who you got it from\u201d video and made it age restricted? Cool. I should drop a fuckin 50 shades of Hopsin porno and really give the world something to flag"

       "plain": "This is the 10th track on Hopsin\u2019s 5th studio album, No Shame. The song is about a woman, (most likely his ex girlfriend Alyce Madden) in which he talks about their relationship.\n\nThis song samples one of Hopsin\u2019s singles, \u201cDie This Way\u201d. It uses a pitch shifted version of a vocal sung by Joey Tee, the artist who also happens to be featured on the song \u201cPanorama City\u201d the 14th track on No Shame.\n\nMusic video for the song was released on February 20th, 2018. It was flagged as inappropriate by Youtube, which is a second song on No Shame that has been flagged, since Youtube deleted Hopsin\u2019s music video for the song \u201cHappy Ending\u201d.\nHopsin commented on the situation on his Instagram post:\n\nSo they flag my \u201cTell\u2019em who you got it from\u201d video and made it age restricted? Cool. I should drop a fuckin 50 shades of Hopsin porno and really give the world something to flag"

Nigga, now what?\"\n[Chorus]\nIf you're lookin' for me I'll be right here, nigga\n818 livin' right here, nigga\nI'm the fuckin' man around here, nigga\nPassin' down the pussy like, \"Here, nigga!\"\nFuck the lavish shit, man, you can have it\nI came up from the gutter like some magic\nAw yeah, niggas sayin' that they want some raw shit back\nIt's right here nigga, here nigga\n\n[Outro]\nNigga, I'll be right here\nPosted on the 818 corner right here\nI'm the fuckin' man in this town right here\nAnd I'ma probably die in this city right here\nY'all can find me right here\nIn Panorama city, aw yeah!\nI hear niggas sayin' that they want some raw shit back\nIt's right here nigga, here nigga\nLet the thing out!\nUndercover Prodigy, forever ill6Embed"

Fuck are you doing?\nI wouldn't do that\nLook buddy, I get it, I know! It's not gonna work\nI wouldn't do that5Embed"

Wack niggas, move it aside\nWhen you heard I was a big deal, you were surprised\nWest Coast, bitch, put your W's in the sky\nI spent my days as a refugee till the rap game came to rescue me\nAnd left my wrist paved in accessories\nA dangerous necessity, I came here to wreck emcees\nYou're wrong if you thinkin' Wayne was the recipe (Nah)\nHe ain't worthy of that, the controversy is back\nGet out the Kool Aid, stir me a batch\nSee, I prefer to relax, but I can't and God knows it\nGotta stay raw with the flow that I'm diagnosed with\nOh shit, niggas keep fuckin' with my emotions\nMaybe that's the reason I suffer from psychosis\nShockin' as high voltage, fuck it, my life's hopeless\nSo I had to make sure I killed it when I wrote this\n[Hook]\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nLike a trampoline\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nLike a trampoline\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nLike a trampoline\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nLike a trampoline\n\n[Verse 2]\nAyo, bounce like a trampoline, thousands are amped as me\nKids, run up on your school campus and slap a dean\nI grew up on baggy jeans, pornographic nasty dreams\nMoral of my damn story, life isn't a happy scene\nWish I was stackin' cream, wish I had a Lamborghin'\nWish I had the cover on a Rolling Stones magazine\nI'm sick of the radio playin' all these faggot teens\nKeep it real, show me somethin' ill that I haven't seen\nFor ten years, I've been workin' on ill flows\nAnd finally got a fuckin' record deal and I'm still broke\nMan, that's not common, bombs that I'm droppin'\nAre dope, but all that I can afford is some Top Ramen\nI notice that ya'll niggas like to dumb the stats\nI should stomp your ass out until your lungs collapse\nNo more corny cowabunga rap, we done with that\nIt's a wrap, keep it up and get your tongue detached\nCome on\nYou might also like[Hook]\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nLike a trampoline\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nLike a trampoline\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nLike a trampoline\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nLike a trampoline\n\n[Verse 3]\nUh, yeah\nI'm the last of a dyin' breed, hip-hop lacks a variety\nThat's the reason I thrash on society\nI get laughed at when I clash with a rivalry\nUntil they feel the wrath when I smash on their dynasty (Word?)\nBut I ain't Hollywood, I'm still the same, kid\nUp on the same shit, rappin' in the basement\nCatch me at your local school, skating, bustin' tre flips\nLeft shoe lace ripped, you know how them days get\nListen while the bass hit, only thing that changed is\nThe way that girls act 'cause now they think I'm amazin'\nI used to be the nigga chicks didn't wanna hang with\nSittin' alone with a Capri Sun and raisins (\"Ew\")\nMy senior year in high school, I was always truant (So?)\nHad a lot of homework but I would never do it (Fuck that)\nScrew it, I'm the king now, homie, take a bow (C'mon)\nYou need the crowd jumpin'? I could probably make 'em bounce\n[Hook]\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nHop can probably make 'em  bounce\nLike a trampoline\nHop can probably make 'em  bounce\nHop can probably make 'em  bounce\nLike a trampoline\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nHop can probably make 'em  bounce\nLike a trampoline\nHop can probably make 'em bounce\nHop can probably make 'em  bounce\nLike a trampoline\n\n[Outro]\nBuckle up...9Embed"

   "lyrics": "Pillow Man Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI've spent about ten years tryna work on my craft\nTryna save this hip-hop shit and disperse of the trash\nBut all my nerves have just crashed 'cause all the verses I've thrashed\nWere meant to benefit my future, I'm uncertain it has\nI rarely ever put something out to insert in your dash\n'Cause as soon as I became a brand, my whole purpose was smashed\nI'm feelin' nervous, in fact, I got no urges to rap\nNow I don't think my fucking life can get more worthless than that\nI see these niggas blowing up who never do got the proper game\nNiggas who fucking suck, Gucci and Waka Flocka Flame\nNiggas who makin' bucks, someone tell me I'm not insane\n'Cause I feel the urge to run up on a bitch ass nigga and rob his chain\nDang! I thought I had it figured out\nSee, I panic and I pout, yo, I've had it, man, I'm out\nGod damn it, this shit's a clout\nI'm the baddest, ain't no doubt\nBut my madness is about to turn me manic 'til I shout\n[Chorus]\nHow come the world is always quick to turn they back on me?\nWon't somebody tell me?\nYou can go ahead and fall asleep\nI'll be in your dreams\nMaybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man\nI'll be in your dreams\nMaybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man\nI'll be in your dreams\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou all assume I'm evil, but actually I'm so nice\nI've always been the lover boy like practically my whole life\nUnhappy here with no wife, don't ask me, I don't know why\nI'm livin' life without no type of strategy to go by\nI knew a bitch who I would go pick up when the day starts\nA bitch who'd even like to watch me skate at the skate park\nA bitch who I was making out with up in the graveyard\nThe same bitch who went and left my ass with a slayed heart\nShe cut it like an avocado\nSecretly hittin' clubs and poppin' bottles\nHanging with thugs or sucking a lots of cock, yo\nThe biggest slut from Loveland, Colorado\nFuck a ho, that's Hopsin's motto\nMy heart is vacant, you knock it's hollow\nShe met another guy who left the baby stuck inside\nHer vagina, then he just split and messed up her fuckin' life\nNow she hits me up and I say, \"Go suck a nut, goodbye\"\nAll you sluts can die for wasting all my sacred love supply\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nHow come the world is always quick to turn they back on me?\nWon't somebody tell me?\nYou can go ahead and fall asleep\nI'll be in your dreams\nMaybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man\nI'll be in your dreams\nMaybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man\nI'll be in your dreams\n\n[Verse 3]\nTo live a decent life, what all does it take?\nI've tried and tried to be the best, but nothing falls in the place\nAnd I'm a man, but my struggle is gonna cause me to break\nAnd just evolve me to hate, I'm in a nauseous state\nAnd, shit, it probably is fate, but who's in control of it, me or God?\nIs he the cause? Then why am I here? The reason's odd\nI'm broke and need a job for spending cheese on broads\nBut y'all don't see the flaws, I coat it up to keep it raw\nAnd MC's who's got the most talent in this whole planet\nDon't never get recognized when they dope at it\nSo they go back to the block hustlin' the dope addicts\nSome niggas got the \"it\" factor, some niggas don't have it\nYo, I'm at my last ends\n'Cause every time I think I'm out the matrix, I get sucked right back in\nBut, man, I'm hopin' things'll change and the soul in me remains\n'Cause the talent that I got is way too cold to be contained\n[Bridge]\nNo, no\nWhat did I do to deserve this?\nNo, no\nI don't even have a purpose\n(Pillow Man) No, no\n(Pillow Man) What did I do to deserve this?\n(Pillow Man) No, no\n(Pillow Man) I don't even have a purpose\n\n[Chorus]\nHow come the world is always quick to turn they back on me?\nWon't somebody tell me?\nYou can go ahead and fall asleep\nI'll be in your dreams\nMaybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man\nI'll be in your dreams\nMaybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man\nI'll be in your dreams4Embed"

I shouldn't have to explain it\nOur foundation should be on some real shit, not you asking for payments\nSo create a dream, then get off your ass and then chase it\nI'm mad and frustrated dealing with this shit, I'm lacking the patience\nYou the homie, I don't mind you coming around dog\nBut I should not have to pay for your downfall\nChoose your faith, but still even if your day seem great\nJust know I got your fucking back either way, you already know\n[Hook: Hopsin]\nI've been there when you needed me the most\nHad your back when you were broke\nI've shown you love when there's no hope\nYou were my friend, like blood\nLike brothers, like family\nAnd I say damn\nWhere would you be without me?\nWithout me\n\n[Verse 2: Hopsin]\nNow my own family tripping, I ain't think I would get this shit from siblings\nThe money I'm making is yours right? It's a given\nLet me tell y'all why I get a different feeling\nY'all was living good watching me and my momma struggle once we get the bills in\nI don't recall any help or sympathies\nSince 15 I been paying rent, you know what that did to me?\nCould have been here, had this rap shit popping off, if y'all had lent the hand\nBut y'all wasn't worried 'bout helping us, you had a different plan\nFocused on yourself, and now you holding on for help\nYou were self centered, and that was just an open door to hell\nOh, you need some money now, yeah of course I know the deal\nYou want the benefits without playing the courses on the field\nYou ain't even doing your best or trying\nDon't ask me for shit unless you dying, this is me testifying\nJust know that when your bright days going straight\nI couldn't have your back without feeling strange but you already know\nYou might also like[Hook: Hopsin]\nI've been there when you needed me the most\nHad your back when you were broke\nI've shown you love when there's no hope\nYou were my friend, like blood\nLike brothers, like family\nAnd I say damn\nWhere would you be without me?\nWithout me\n\n[Verse 3: Hopsin]\nMoney can leave you isolated 'cause people are shady\nSo why debate it? They love cash and fantasize to make it\nTo get it, we'll fight and break shit, develop unrighteous ways\nEven taking the side with Satan, thankfully I've awaken\nFoes who abused the privilege by having those who were gifted\nAround them close and they vision, stop corroding your friendships\nDon't be having your hands out, smiling, hoping to get shit\nMooching off of a man's treasure is bogus and it's just\nNot the way you should function with brothers when you're amongst 'em\nThat is what we call punk shit and it can leave you stuck in\nA boat that's already sunken, this can happen to anyone\nSisters, brothers and cousins, they disrespecting, then fuck 'em\nThat's the way that the fountain leaks, keep on pushing your boundaries\nIn due time I am bound to see all the snakes that surrounded me\nI know that if my brightest days turn gray\nYou wouldn't have my back unless there was pay, it ain't no secret\n[Hook: Hopsin]\nI've been there when you needed me the most\nHad your back when you were broke\nI've shown you love when there's no hope\nYou were my friend, like blood\nLike brothers, like family\nAnd I say damn\nWhere would you be without me?\nWithout me11Embed"

Here's a riddle, son\nCut all my fingers off except the middle ones (what?)\nNow, bend your ass over and sit on one (what?)\nA.K.A. I've lost it, nigga, run (woo)\nWhole world gettin' so sick of em\nMy nuts swing like a pendulum\nI'm on Instagram right now postin' pics of 'em\nThey are so cute together, aren't they? Look at them (aw)\nOne's bigger than the other though\nJust thought I'd let you motherfuckers know\nI'm posted in a bungalow, gettin' deepthroat from a juggalo\nPlease do not get your face paint on my stomach, ho\nWhere the real MCs? There are no more\nSwag ship took sail and they all on board\nHolla at me when you wanna learn the art of war\nA carnivore, flexing hard like I'm Arnold Schwarz\nI'm explicit business, witness sickness\nSpit from the lips of mischief\nTalk shit, get hit, I can split your wig\nWith a knife into your dome with my fist to clinch it (that's murder, homie)\nOh shit, oh my, hit a nigga like I'm Kimbo Slice\nAnd spend your life, so bitch, don't try\nI throw you out a fuckin window, bye\nAnd film it on Vine to get more likes (well, alright)\nSoon as that cyclone hits\nYou know I'm back on that psycho shit\nI got psychosis\nMy brain's filled with deadly microchips\nI'm plotting your death with crayons and hieroglyphs\n(You crazy, nigga!) Ha, I know this\nIn the club too turnt, tryna fight your bitch\nSwing at me, nigga, I won't flinch\nCan't you see my fucking mind's on Grinch?\nI love violence\n[Chorus: Hopsin]\nI'm like damn, shit\nFuck, nigga, shit\nI just can't deal with these niggas no more, man\nYeah, yeah, nigga\nI just can't deal with these niggas no more, man\nYeah, yeah, nigga\nI just can't deal with these niggas no more\n\n[Verse 2: Hopsin]\nPut a nigga in that stove (like roast)\nI know you phoned 5-0, I'm ghost\nStraight through the exit\nFuck a ho and use the same condom on the next bitch\nNasty-ass nigga having sex with a dead chick\nFilm it with the GoPro, slow-mo, and upload it to Netflix\nUh, excuse me, I hate to bother\nDo you know where I can find a little Asian parlor?\nWhere they'll play with my balls like a game of soccer\nAnd fuck me, too, for like eighty dollars?\nI need my dick scrubbed and bathed in water\nI hold the bitch down to play some doctor\nIf I ask her for it, it's gon' make it awkward\nIf I tip her well, she'll give brains and swallow (oh, yeah)\nI'm a nutcase with ADD\nWho rapes these beats, don't try cause you can't be me\nYa'll can't be pleased, stop hatin' on my angry steez\nIt makes me cheese, I barely know my ABC's\nBut still I'm on and I made like (two million bucks)\nOh, look at y'all niggas now (you give a fuck)\nShit, askin' to be on my team\nTryna take my goddamn cream, 'cause you niggas stuck\nSame niggas always name droppin'\nLike, \"Aye, Hopsin, I rap too, I'm tryna get paid off it\nDre heard my shit and said it was great\nI'll probably get signed to Eminem any day\nAnd next week, Snoop Dogg, he gon' get me blazed\nOne time, I opened up a concert for MGK\nMy big partner, lil cousin, man, he friends with Drake\nAnd Big Boy up at Power said he'll get me play\nI had a video on Worldstar, dawg, believe it\nI don't know what happened but it got deleted\"\nMan, if you don't get your ass out of my God damn face talkin' that bullshit, nigga!\nStop it with the lies, dude, I'ma just remind you\nI hate phony niggas, I will not pretend to like you\nThirsty ass niggas love talkin' when I slide through\nFuck you, nigga, you ain't hoppin' into my crew\nYou might also like[Hook: Hopsin]\nDamn, shit\nFuck, nigga\nI just can't deal with these niggas no more, man\nYeah, yeah, nigga\nI just can't deal with these niggas no more, man\nYeah, yeah\nI just can't deal with these niggas no more\nFuck, shit\nMan, I just can't deal with these niggas no more, man\nFuck, shit, damn\nI just can't deal with these niggas no more8Embed"

It was produced by Harry Fraud and recorded at Hop\u2019s home studio in Los Angeles.\n\nAnd I have one beat, \u201cBlack Sheep\u201d that was made by Harry Fraud who\u2019s from out here in New York [\u2026] Well, this song, it actually came about in 2015. When Funk Volume was ending, I was in a space where I was trying to expand and try new things and work with producers cause I wasn\u2019t fully doing that as much back then so I flew out to New York and met up with Harry Fraud and I went to his studio in Brooklyn and we just chilled and vibed out. He played some beats [\u2026] And I told him I was gonna come back later and I'ma write some verses to it but I ended up rerecording everything in my studio and he sent me all of the stems for the beat.

That's where I went to school at\nAll the black kids said I was white-washed\nAnd the white kids said I was too black\nWhen I skateboarded I got booed at\nAt lunchtime I was who they threw food at\nI was tryin' so hard to cope with it\nI really wanted to run up on campus with two gats\nAnd just (ahh) let loose\nPut some niggas in the E.R. for tryna treat me like a retard\nWhere the fuck does my future lie? I can't see far\nMomma's little sweetheart, he developed an attitude\nPicked up a mic, that's a Hell of an avenue\nHe gon' take yo' ass to Hell and then back with you\nLife is a class you can tell I've been absent to\nMy massive doubt has got me wrapped around\nAnd then it drags me down a bit\nI don't know how to cast it out\nI try to rap profound so you could laugh about the shit\nTruth is, yo, I never laugh\nI'm lookin' for wherever Heaven's at\nThe black sheep, they won't let him past\nThey would rather get together\nTie him up and then behead his ass, got me hella sad\nListen!\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus: Hopsin]\nDo you ever feel like the world is never gon' want you?\nLike the world is never gon' need you?\nI always do, every day is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for me\n\n[Chorus: Hopsin & Eric Tucker]\nAnd I act like I don't give a fuck, but I do give a fuck\nAnd I'm trapped inside my mind, there ain't no loosenin' up\nMaybe I'm thinkin' too much, am I caught in my feelings?\nAre the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?\nI'm the black sheep (the black sheep)\nThe black sheep (the black sheep)\nIt's like the rain is fallin' on me, you don't know what I deal with\nOh, I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)\nThe black sheep (the black sheep)\nAre the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?\nOh, I'm the black sheep\n\n[Verse 2: Hopsin]\nThat nigga whose brain is off, I am that\nMy train of thought left on Amtrak\nI take the loss and I stand back\nI can't play the cards with no hand clap\nI can't recall when this damn crap\nBecame so overwhelmin' I started rebellin'\n\"I hate\" is all as I stand as\nNever got no love from my niggas\nAnd no love from the hoes, pinned up in a hole\nTryna climb out the Devil's dark lab, but the oven is closed\nI don't ever leave the house much\nI never really thought this would be the outcome\nWish I had a window I was leapin' out from\nMy family is yellin', \"Please, Jesus, help him!\"\nWhen I'm out in the real world, I feel like nobody knows me\nWhat if this whole time I've had an issue and nobody told me?\nSee, this cold heart isn't cozy\nAm I below par and I don't see?\nI'm so disconnected from Earth\nMy hands are out so far but they won't reach\nShould I get in a coffin?\nNot many niggas would wanna kick it with me\nUnless they were gonna benefit of it\nMotherfuckers never interested in knowin' me\nThey just be just itchin' for Hopsin\nI'd be frontin' if I act like it isn't a problem\nI done shed tears contemplatin' my suicide in my room\nIsn't it awesome? (Fuck no!)\n[Pre-Chorus: Hopsin]\nDo you ever feel like the world is never gon' want you?\nLike the world is never gon' need you?\nI always do, every day is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for me\n\n[Chorus: Hopsin & Eric Tucker]\nAnd I act like I don't give a fuck, but I do give a fuck\nAnd I'm trapped inside my mind, there ain't no loosenin' up\nMaybe I'm thinkin' too much, am I caught in my feelings\nAre the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?\nI'm the black sheep (the black sheep)\nThe black sheep (the black sheep)\nIt's like the rain is fallin' on me, you don't know what I deal with\nI'm the black sheep (the black sheep)\nThe black sheep (the black sheep)\nAre the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?\nI'm the black sheep (the black sheep)\nIt's like the rain is fallin' on me, you don't know what I deal with\nI'm the black sheep (the black sheep)\nThe black sheep (the black sheep)\nAre the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?\nI'm the black sheep (the black sheep)\nThe black sheep (the black sheep)\nIt's like the rain is fallin' on me, you don't know what I deal with\nI'm the black sheep (the black sheep)\nThe black sheep (the black sheep)\nAre the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?\nOh, I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)13Embed"

Think again, yo\n[Chorus]\nFame can make you insane (It's so strange)\nEveryday I feel I'm caught in the rain\nOnly very few have walked in my shoes\nI sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused\n'Cause I don't know who the hell I am\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, scared I might never get a wife\nCloser I move into the limelight shit is like\nGirls just want to be next to me 'cause I rip the mic\nSayin' they love me, but the vibe I get isn't right\nWhat if I flop when my album dropped\nAnd went broke? Baby, tell me, would your love just stop?\nSee I'm in love with you, but you in love with Hop\nThe struggle's real, but through your eyes it's fun to watch\nI swear to god I used to fiend for it\nI see the fire but I keep going\nI smell the sins from the breeze blowin'\nMy crew is telling me to beast mode it\nI feel like I'm going to hell, I keep it up even my priest knows it\nSo many women and the money is great\nBut this life just isn't me and I don't want to be fake\nI didn't think that it would come to this day\nIt's time I put my alter ego to the side and leave him stuck in his grave\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nFame can make you insane (It's so strange)\nEveryday I feel I'm caught in the rain\nOnly very few have walked in my shoes\nI sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused\n'Cause I don't know who the hell I am\n\n[Verse 3]\nShit, not anymore, my soul's rotten and sore\nI hear a knock at the door, for real\nI got a lot to endure, there ain't no stopping the storm\nHomie, the top isn't warm, so chill\nI think I need my light bulb fixed\nAs of lately I ain't be getting hyped on shit\nLife's a journey, you gotta find your niche\nI'm leaving this tight space because I don't fit\nNow I'm moving away, my whole life I'ma start it from scratch\nAs an artist I'm trapped, fuck Hop, Marcus is back\nFor a while it's gon' be hard to adapt\nBut I'm willing to go through it, I ain't starving to rap\nI'm soul searching, it's like I'm living with no purpose\nI tried find a spark to spit but there's no urges\nInside of me for me to pursue it, some people think that I'm stupid\nBut don't judge if you ain't went through it\nI'm out\n[Chorus (Extended)]\nFame can make you insane (It's so strange)\nEveryday I feel I'm caught in the rain\nOnly very few have walked in my shoes\nI sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused\n'Cause I don't know who the hell I am\nFame can make you insane (It's so strange)\nEveryday I feel I'm caught in the rain\nOnly very few have walked in my shoes\nI sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused\n'Cause I don't know who the hell I am\nFame can make you insane (It's so strange)\nEveryday I feel I'm caught in the rain\nOnly very few have walked in my shoes\nI sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused\n'Cause I don't know who the hell I am6Embed"

As mentioned, it focuses on his sexual needs and the girl\u2019s financial needs, detailing the subsequent dynamic of their casual relationship."

   "lyrics": "Gimmie That Money Lyrics[Verse 1]\nBack when I was a young nigga playing in the sand\nI had some big dreams so I made a little plan\nYou was out partying while I was thinking in advance\nTryna get right hoping that one day I'd be the man\nThe years went by, I was M.I.A\nI got rid of all of the niggas that was in my way\nI saved nickels and quarters till I could afford a studio\nTo record and then get money off the shit I say\nThen my dream came true and the fraud niggas came out\nSee me ballin' out, they think we all gettin' paid now\nTalking like \"Hopsin, oh you're a great pal\"\nFuck you, stick my balls in your dang mouth\nNow every other week you hit me up for money\nFrontin' like you always been down (pal!)\nBut back then when a nigga was living bummy\nYour ass was nowhere to be found (wow!)\nLook my nigga (Marcus) I ain't tryin to be one of ya fake ass goldigger\nHomies that's not it (that's not what I'm doin)\nBut can I borrow 500 dollers I'mma pay ya ass back next week I promise (please)\n[Chorus]\nI can't even make friends\n'Cause all they ever do is ask for my money\nThey like, \"Let me have this, let me have that\nLet me have this\" and they keep on coming, man\n\"Let me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere was a chick I asked out back in \u201906\nMade her a love song, and she was like \u201cNo bitch\u201d\nGave me the song back, and I was like \u201cOh shit\nI\u2019m so stupid, I should\u2019ve never wrote this\u201d\nShe was a dime piece, top of the list\nA Latin girl, and her skin had a tropical twist\nShe never used to call me, I always had to call her\nAnd deep down inside it was making my heart hurt\nSo her life went on, she didn\u2019t even involve me\nThen last year I ran into her in a Walgreens\nShe was like, \u201cMarcus, how are you? (oh my God)\nYou finally made it, I\u2019m so proud of you\u201d\nSo the next day she called me and asked to kick it\nFor the sake of the old me that was sad, I did it\nCome to find out she was never that terrific\nEspecially a week later when she asked me this shit\n\u201cHey um, Marcus, I really really hate to be a bother\nBut my rent is due, and I\u2019m like broke as fuck\nSo can you please lend me ten hundred dollars, please\u201d\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI can't even make friends\n'Cause all they ever do is ask for my money\nThey like, \"Let me have this, let me have that\nLet me have this\" and they keep on coming, man\n\"Let me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nMmm-hmm\nSee my ex girl think she slick\nMan let me tell ya how she tried to do me\nShe said she didn\u2019t have a vehicle to drive to work in\nSo she came and asked me for 2 Gs\nAnd although I wasn\u2019t that concerned\nShe said her mom would pay me back, soon as she got her tax return\nSo I committed and did it, thinkin\u2019 she wouldn\u2019t forget it\nBut she forgot it, now my stomach got a nasty burn\nI called her! And said, \u201cBitch! Where my money?! You got that?!\u201d\nShe said, \u201cNot yet, see my mom\u2019s mad\nShe said she isn\u2019t gonna pay, you can drop dead\n'Cause I got into a fight with her, she\u2019s a hot head\u201d\nI\u2019m like, \u201cThat\u2019s between you two, not me!\nWhat the hell does that have to do with my cheese!\u201d\nShe said, \u201cOk, ok, stop please\nI swear I\u2019ll pay it all back Marcus, in five weeks\u201d\nHuh, five weeks huh?\nIt\u2019s been three months and I ain\u2019t even heard from her\nChanged her damn number, shit\nBitch played me like a dumb motherfucker\n[Chorus]\nI can't even make friends\n'Cause all they ever do is ask for my money\nThey like, \"Let me have this, let me have that\nLet me have this\" and they keep on coming, man\n\"Let me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\"\n\n[Outro]\nGive me that dough, Give me that money\nGive me that cheese, Give me that money\nGive me that yea yea yea, Give me that money\nYea yea, Give me that money\nSay yea yea yea yea\nBaby give me that yea yea yea yea\nGive me that yea yea yea yea! Ha\nThis for the bitches that oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo\n(exhales) fuck\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna be able to pay Marcus back\nAh7Embed"

    "plain": "This track sees Hopsin & SwizZz speak on the beginnings and progression of their label, Funk Volume \u2013 a label they\u2019d love till the day they died.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately however, at the beginning of 2016, Hopsin posted to social media that he and Dame, FV\u2019s co-founder, were having issues. He went on to call Dame \u201cthe death of Funk Volume\u201d and even said if Dame didn\u2019t walk away, he would. On January 6, 2016, Hopsin posted the following message to his fans:\n\nFunk volume is officially dead now thanks to the monster Damien Ritter. There is nobody else to blame at all. I have officially separated myself from everything and I am fully independent now. It\u2019s very sad but idiots like dame wanna control too Much and now he end up destroying a great fuckin team. Having a crew like FV has been my vision since I was 14 years old and this man just destroyed it. Jarren, Dizzy, Swizzz, Dj Hoppa and I are all still on good terms. They will forever be my brothers and I support them in whatever they do. I will let u guys know the full story soon. You know ama keep it RAW for real. Ain\u2019t no holdin back. Im so sorry to all the FV fans. There\u2019s a brighter future though."

He went on to call Dame \u201cthe death of Funk Volume\u201d and even said if Dame didn\u2019t walk away, he would. On January 6, 2016, Hopsin posted the following message to his fans:\n\nFunk volume is officially dead now thanks to the monster Damien Ritter. There is nobody else to blame at all. I have officially separated myself from everything and I am fully independent now. It\u2019s very sad but idiots like dame wanna control too Much and now he end up destroying a great fuckin team. Having a crew like FV has been my vision since I was 14 years old and this man just destroyed it. Jarren, Dizzy, Swizzz, Dj Hoppa and I are all still on good terms. They will forever be my brothers and I support them in whatever they do. I will let u guys know the full story soon. You know ama keep it RAW for real. Ain\u2019t no holdin back. Im so sorry to all the FV fans. There\u2019s a brighter future though."

Can you remind me\nIt's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga\n\n[Verse 1: Hopsin]\nYeah, you behind if you don't know the power (nigga)\nPlotted this shit the moment Ruthless started goin' sour (what?)\nNiggas is sayin' fuck you to us, but we have spoke it louder\nNow they come to us for advice in the game, they know it's ours (true)\nCause It's so hard just to survive in this era\nWe learn from trial and error, it's hard for cowards to bare us\nThey know the style is terror, nigga we everywhere\nYeezy and Hov ain't the only niggas that's wildin' in Paris\nBack in the day, me and my nigga SwizZz was always in grind mode\nReppin' that 818 was just like walkin' that tightrope\nWe've seen rappers come and go and get lost in this cycle\nSo we had to fuckin' make sure we left all of your minds blown\nSwizZz? He told me 'bout his brother Damien sayin' that he could create a structure for us\nWe're guaranteed to make a win\nI said I'm in, let the games begin\nSo he introduced us, then after that\nWe plotted on some ways to make us trend, yeah\n[Chorus: Hopsin]\nYa'll ain't even seen the nigga Hop coming\nThat's how I roll, dawg\nThe second niggas take they eyes off me\nI leave 'em on the side of the road, dawg\nI'm the realest, believe me\nNiggas can't see me, they'll take a life to be me\nYe-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me\nIt's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga\n\n[Verse 2: Hopsin]\nYou see, I took a shot out of the glass of mischief\nMade an album so raw the way you just had to get it, every track explicit\nI figured those of you who was in love with rap would listen\nAnd tell your parents that it's the one gift they should grab for Christmas\nThen I blew up way faster than what I had predicted\nIt's like magic, isn't it, they love my language and graphic image\nSome people thought Ruthless put me into a bad position\nBut I over came it and outshined 'em, I'm back up in it\n2011, went on a nation wide tour\nCame back and dropped that Ill Mind 4\nThat put me in a cool place, swiped up a million views in a few days\nI celebrated inside of swimming pools sippin' Kool Aid\nI shot a video with my nigga Tech and B.o.B\nI went from feeling lonely to how does everyone know me?\n2012, I made the XXL Freshman list\nI knew that this fuckin' game was gon' be mine when I stepped in it\nCome on, man\nYou might also like[Chorus: Hopsin]\nYa'll ain't even seen the nigga Hop coming\nThat's how I roll, dawg\nThe second niggas take they eyes off me\nI leave 'em on the side of the road, dawg\nI'm the realest, believe me\nNiggas can't see me, they'll take a life to be me\nYe-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me\nIt's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga\n\n[Verse 3: Hopsin]\nI was online chillin', bloggin' and whatnot (okay)\nI stumbled across this one nigga, reminded me of a young Pac (right)\nI asked Dame if he heard of Dizzy he said, \"Come on Hop\nI been bumpin' his shit before you, bruh, his songs hot.\"\nIf he had that push, then so many doors'll become unlocked\nHe said we should sign him, I said that's a long shot\nWe flew him to Denver to see our show and said you fuck with this shit?\nHe said, \"Shit nigga, yiggity yamp, I'm up in this bitch.\"\nA few months later, one of the homies had stopped me\nAsked if I had seen this raunchy, zombie filled, godly video, that's beyond beast\nI said, \"probably, I don't know, who the fuck you speakin 'bout?\"\nHe showed me Skitzo by Jarren Benton, I started freakin' out!\nI'm like, oh shit! I had to show SwizZz\nAnd Dame and they both flipped, it's a trip, this nigga's so sick!\nWe had to put him on quick and blow this nigga up\nNow we got a serious squad, the truth, it is nuts\n[Verse 4: SwizZz]\nYo, I took the college route to figure out my path in life\nRomp the UCI and that lead me right back behind the mic\nI tried to make my dad proud, brother got his MBA\nWhile I was wildin', takin' random classes tryna find my way\nJunior year, I had to bounce not to blindly chasin' dream\nCalculated riffs, I knew that I devised a perfect scheme\nHop was gazin' at the moonlight, I just hit the valley scene\nDame got rocked by the recession, then we formed the fuckin' team\nF-U-N-K-V-O-L-U-M-E, nigga\nSeven years into this shit, somehow we're only gettin' bigger\nAnd we're just now gonna start the shit, I've been up out the picture\nDizzy, Hop, Jarren, and Hoppa stay confident I deliver\nSo I'm grateful for the chance and the position that I'm placed\nMeet the aftermath, the aftermath, the Funk is in your face\nIndependent livin', we control every decision made\nWhat up Dame? Prepare the reign, we killin' this thing, it won't stop, bitch!\n\n[Outro: Hopsin & SwizZz]\nHaha, Zzzeed up\nDon't act like you don't know what time it is fool\nSwizZz\nDizzy motherfuckin' Wright\nJarren Benton\nDJ Hoppa\nLet's make it\n\n[Chorus (Condensed): Hopsin]\nYe-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me\nIt's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga8Embed"

Girl I'm tired and I'm snoring\n'Cause your vibe is just annoying, and I'm tired of ignoring\nAnd avoiding and supporting this shit, and plus I'm horny\nYou think I'm really into that? Girl, put an end to that\nI just want to get the snatch, Ching, Ching, hit the jackpot!\nBitch open up your legs like a laptop\nTake a fat cock, yeah, then I'll let your ass talk\nBut otherwise, if you don't, we gon' slap box\nFuck around and ride up on yo block and get yo ass popped\nWasting my time, now I'm wasting my rhymes\nMaking this song? 'Cause you ain't got naked yet, ho?\nYou think I put that time in for nothing?\nFuck that girl, we either fighting, or fucking!\nAnd I ain't playing wit' you girl, I'd hate to diss you\nNo wait, I like to diss you\nTurn this shit to wilder issues\n\n[Hook]\nBitch who do you think I am?\nMy boyfriend dumped me, I'm so lonely (So?)\nBitch who do you think I am?\nJames always act like he don't want me!

What happened?\n\u2014 He dumped me\n\u2014 Man shoot\n\u2014 He told me he doesn't love me anymore {Bitch crying}\n[Verse 3]\nI couldn't kick it wit' yo ass a while ago\nAnd now you want to hang 'cause he ain't around no mo'?\nWhat the fuck I look like, after he fucked you?\nAnd he dumped you? Now I'm the dude you run to?\nWhen he wants you, I'ma be the one you flee from soon\nThen I'll become the one you got your finger up to?\nIt ain't my motherfucking life, you think I care? Ha!

Why do I feel\nLike I'd be runnin' in fear if ever the end was near?\"\nIt's like, sin is in so much of everyone's daily habits\nThat we don't even know we do it whenever it happens\nThen it settles in like I should've never did that shit\nI wanna enter the gate perfect rather than have this\nIf you had to turn your test in today\nYou think you would pass it or would you rest in the flame?\nWho knows, there's only one way to find out\nAnd if you die now, no turnin' back, it's your life pal\n\n[Hook]\nGazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to thee\nHe says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me\nOh na\u2014na\u2014naaah\nGazing at the moonlight, the Devil comes close to me\nBut mama told me never to talk to strangers6Embed"

   "lyrics": "Your House Lyrics[Verse 1]\nMan, I don't even know what happened\nI was born inside of this shit\nMy fucking parents\u2005scrappin',\u2005I was mortified\u2005as a kid\nPolice always at my\u2005house all because of my daddy's temper\nMan, this shit been going on 'bout as long as I can remember\nHe always blamed my mom for the shit he didn't accomplish\nI'd hide in the corner like a guinea pig in the process\nJust knowing he 'bout to smack the fucking teeth out her mouth\nIt's like when it came to some type of drama\nHe got aroused, no joke\nThere was the moments where dad would slowly be creeping up\nI would jump in front of my mama: \"Please don't beat her up\"\nI ain't never spoke on this shit, the memories are rough\nSmiles and hugs, that's just something you'll never see in us\nYou know the pain when your parents tell you to go and play\nThen hours later you see your mom and she got a swollen face\nI hope you don't relate, I just learned how to cope today\nFrom the days when I would pick up the phone and say\n[Chorus]\nI gotta leave here now\nMy mom and dad acting crazy and this ain't right\nAnd they've been going back and forth all night\nI wanna stay at your house tonight\n'Cause I don't wanna hear my dad fightin\u2019 momma no more\nI don't wanna hear the police at the front door\nCan I stay at your house?\nI wanna stay at your house tonight (Your house tonight)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI would go to school feeling so frightened, yeah, I was scared\nNot knowing if I'ma go home finding my momma dead\nEvery other fucking day, dad was always losing control\nHe was acting like a fucking ape, runnin' loose in our home\nMan ever since I was born they was pessimistic and torn\nIt's evident, but regardless they'd never get a divorce\nGod, I wish they got around it, just checking into some counselin'\nWe could have been a happy family inside our house again\nI said again as if we ever were, that's false\nShit I dealt with growing up, will forever hurt, I'm lost\nWe were nothing like the families I used to see on the sitcoms\nWe were horrible with bonds, I can no longer sit calm\nI would see that my friends had a life at home that was peaceful\nThey were lovable people, who didn't function like we do\nOh how I wish I could redo the pain of the wicked days\nWhen I'd pick up the telephone, call a friend and say\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI gotta leave here now\nMy mom and dad acting crazy and this ain't right\nAnd they've been going back and forth all night\nI wanna stay at your house tonight\n'Cause I don't wanna hear my dad fightin\u2019 momma no more\nI don't wanna hear the police at the front door\nCan I stay at your house?\nI wanna stay at your house tonight (Your house tonight)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI ain't placing the blame saying it's mom or dad's fault\nBut all those traumas I had stuck with me as an adult\nAnd it ignited these mad thoughts that I seem to have often\nYeah, that's Hopsin, music is where my last straw went\nNow I'm devoted to always give you my true life\nThe love I never felt growing up I get it from you guys\nPlease don't get it twisted, I love both my parents to death\nI just think there's issues a lot of fucking parents neglect\nWe all got these traumas we carry and sometimes it's scary\n'Cause we buried a nest, right there in our chest\nAnd we subconsciously air and project our nightmares and the stress that we dealt with when we were younger\nAnd that's why therapy\u2019s best, listen\nIf you got kids of your own and you throwing tantrums\nDon't be oblivious and assume that it won't impact them\nChildren follow the protocol of their parents blueprint\nSo when there's an issue, they might handle it just how you did (You did, you did)\n[Chorus]\nI gotta leave here now\nMy mom and dad acting crazy and this ain't right\nAnd they've been going back and forth all night\nI wanna stay at your house tonight\n'Cause I don't wanna hear my dad fightin\u2019 momma no more\nI don't wanna hear the police at the front door\nCan I stay at your house?\nI wanna stay at your house tonight (Your house tonight)16Embed"

I'ma hit a mothafucka with the pound, pound, pound, pound\nIt's the Pound Syndrome\nGood God the pound, the pound, the pound, the pound\nUn-unbelievable Pound Syndrome\nCan you, can you, ca-can you believe it?\nThe Pound, the-the-the-the-the\nThe pound, the pound, the pound, the pound, the pound\n\n[Verse]\nIf you're looking for trouble then you found it, the new album\nOf two-thousand-and-fifteen, I'm too violent\nThis shit seems like I'm cooped out with lucid dreams\nI'm a new route for these emcee's\nThis is a drought that's coming\nI'm about to sprout to start a new style's full of envy\nI need to cool down what is in me\nEverything I had bottled up pukes out when the pen bleeds\nYou drown from a 16, who's doubtin' the sick steeze?\nI could spit a wild verse without taking a breath\nThen crowd surf, who's helping this kid breathe?\nThe worlds against me so I gotta come harder than the average\nThink smarter than the masses\nEverybody's on the move, ain't no time to get caught up in the traffic\nWhen shit goes down I got the heart of an assassin\nThis here's harder than my last shit\nGotta do it now, no luck in tomorrow if it crashes\nIf I do die before I awake, I don't think too many will feel sorrow for my ashes\nWith this song I've frozen time, don't skip this, don't rewind\nThe throne is mine, close your eyes as I provoke the mind\nThis was bound to happen before I wrote the lines\nAnd it's so divine the way my influence multiplied\nIt's like I created a cult inside this rap industry\nPlease don't look so surprised\nI'm at the top, I ain't throwing down a rope to climb, come on\n[Outro]\nPound, pound, pound, pound\nIt's the Pound Syndrome\nGood God the pound, the pound, the pound, the pound\nUn-unbelievable Pound Syndrome\nCan you, can you, ca-can you believe it?\nThe Pound, the-the-the-the-the\nThe pound, the pound, the pound, the pound, the poundYou might also like7Embed"

How you make a whole lot of money like white man?\"\nJust know I does it, this shit, is nothing\nAsk 'round I buzz to smash down the sluts and I am erupting\nFar from reluctant, bringing the funds in\nI love this, you dumb bitch\nWho am I? Hope you guessed amazing\nJust embrace it, been underestimated\nLeft for bait, and now I'm 'bout to head to greatness\nI gets down like a nigga weapon raisin'\nNo hesitation with the bad upbringing\nYou can tell from hotels, I'm sexing babes\nAnd I'm the man that's the best of statements\nNow I rest my case, man\nFuck this shitYou might also like2Embed"

I don't have control\nI need a chaperone when I'm back at home in a padded zone\n'Cause I've been known to speak in a savage tone and slap a ho\nDo I even have a soul?\nMy thoughts are so unimaginable\nMy brain just hasn't grown\nSince I climbed through my momma's vaginal\nAnd I been asked to go to a shrink, it ain't gon' happen, bro\nSuck a dick and swallow a massive load!\nBitch, I can explode at any moment\nDon't get me goin', 'cause a lot can happen\nYou talkin' crap and wake up in a fuckin' Saw contraption\nA raw assassin, you see me you better be haulin' ass then\nYour gashes cannot be treated with Tylenol or Aspirin\nNo cotton swab or napkin can clean the mess up\nIt's me and my alter ego against the world, it's just us\nAin't no one who textin' my cellular phone except sluts\nIt's clear there's a problem with me, so guess what?\n\n[Hook]\nI must be on somethin'\nLately I been actin' kinda cuckoo\nMomma said I got a screw or two loose\nI must be on somethin'\nThe doctor couldn't snap me out of my new mood\nI ain't just been feelin' like I used to\nI must be on somethin'\nI been lost and ain't nobody found me\nTo be honest it ain't safe to be around me\nI must be on somethin'\nThis shit isn't normal, maybe it's my hormones\nFuck it, man, Lord knows\nI must be on somethin'\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nThe world has fucked me, it's time to get even now\nThey say I'm the one no one wants to be around\nGuess it's my deceivin' smile\nGuess it's because I been treatin' people foul\nMakin' songs about 'em, talkin' shit and then freakin' out\nThis is how I handle all solutions\nThere's no false illusion\nFuck an evil witch, bitch, I'm the demon that's off the broom stick\nWhere's the fire? I'm walkin' through it\nY'all ain't got the balls to do it\nI'm talkin' stupid, it's all inclusive\nWith my psychotic state, filled with a lot of hate\nI'ma operate on my enemies\nChop 'em up and then drop 'em on pots and plates\nI'm not to fuck with, so stop it, let's not debate\nUsually never talkin' much 'cause I'm stuck in a awkward state\nThe pain I have's everlastin'\nWon't be surprised when I'm left in ashes from my hellish habits\nThe hell is happenin'?\nThe condition I'm in is probably worse than you can imagine\nMake sure you say this shit to whoever's askin'\n\n[Hook]\nHe must be on somethin'\nLately I been actin' kinda cuckoo\nMomma said I got a screw or two loose\nI must be on somethin'\nThe doctor couldn't snap me out of my new mood\nI ain't just been feelin' like I used to\nI must be on somethin'\nI been lost and ain't nobody found me\nTo be honest it ain't safe to be around me\nI must be on somethin'\nThis shit isn't normal, maybe it's my hormones\nFuck it, man, Lord knows\nI must be on somethin'5Embed"

She's finally 'bout to meet her soulmate\nIt's still trippin' her out; she's like \"No way\"\nNo more sad lonely nights of straight horror\nTomorrow she's meeting the lover God made for her\nShe's looking in the mirror, dancing around the house\nWith a mess of clothes on the bed trying on outfits\nShe's acting out how the day is probably gonna be\nLike \"Hi Pete, I'm so glad we finally get to meet\"\nShe thinks to herself, \"Hmm, I know what I should do\nI'ma call Nicole up and tell her all the good news\"\nIt went to voice mail 'cause Nicole was sleeping\nSo Lauren left a message, like \"Girl, I'm gonna see him\"\nShe hangs up and falls back on the bed smiling\nLooking at the ceiling, daydreaming in dead silence\nEventually her daydreaming turns into sleep\nIt's love that she's feeling and yes the feeling is sweet\n\n[Chorus]\nCyber, sexy cyber\nSexy cyber, I love her\nSexy cyber, sexy cyber\nShe's my sexy cyber girl\nCyber, sexy cyber\nSexy cyber, I love her\nSexy cyber, sexy cyber\nShe's my sexy cyber girl\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nIt already hit morning; oh darn\nBut Lauren so excited she wakes up before the alarm\nAnd calls Pete, to see exactly where they're gonna meet\nThen Pete picks up and tries to act like he was asleep\nLauren's like \"So where we meeting at? We could try my place?\"\nPete's like \"Nah, how 'bout TGI Fridays?\nI really love you Lauren, and I know you trust me\nBut it's our first time meeting, I don't wanna rush things\"\nShe says, \"That's fine, I'll see you at twelve\nUntil then I love you baby, hope you'll be doing well\" *Mwah*\nShe takes a shower, does her hair and all that girl stuff\nMake-up, lip stick, neck and wrist pearled up\nNow it's about time she heads on out to Teej\nShe text messages Pete, \"Hey, I'm about to leave\"\nAnd she's so damn excited as her heart pounds and beats\nThat she almost left the house without her keys, geez\n\n[Chorus]\nCyber, sexy cyber\nSexy cyber, I love her\nSexy cyber, sexy cyber\nShe's my sexy cyber girl\nCyber, sexy cyber\nSexy cyber, I love her\nSexy cyber, sexy cyber\nShe's my sexy cyber girl\n[Verse 3]\nShe pulls up, but Pete hasn't arrived yet\nShould she go in without him; she hasn't decided\nShe doesn't really know how he would act if she tried it\nSo she just sits back and just relaxes her eyelids\nIt's twelve-twenty, Lauren picks up an appetite\nShe decides to go inside without him and have a bite\nThen her phone rings, it's Pete so she answers it\nPete says \"Baby, I'm gonna have to cancel it\"\nLauren says \"Why? What happened? What is it?\"\nThen Pete says \"I just heard my grandmother's real sick\nAnd I have to go and give her a visit\"\nThen Lauren says \"It's okay, baby, go handle your business\"\nShe loves him too much, so it didn't really bother her\nShe hops in the car, pulls off, a truck follows her\nBut she don't even notice 'cause her music's too loud\nAnd she just caught up in the zone of a Ludacris album\nNow she's home, she opens the door, moves to get out\nSoon as the foot hits the ground, a man rushes up and pushes her down\nShe drops her keys; the man picks 'em up\nThen drags her by her feet into her house like he don't give a fuck\nHe slapped her, then put tape on her mouth\nTo take from the sound of Lauren screaming rape really loud\nHe's going ballistic, her face is covered with lipstick\nThen he yells out \"Bitch, Pete never existed!\"\nHer heads spinning, then she just faints\nThe man rips off her clothes and Lauren gets raped\nFrom that day on nobody ever heard from her\n'Cause that so called Pete guy went and murdered her\nHe tossed her body in a off-road ditch\nHe said to her \"see you at the crossroad, bitch\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSexy cyber, sexy cyber\nCyber, cyber\n\n[Chorus]\nCyber, sexy cyber\nSexy cyber, I love her\nSexy cyber, sexy cyber\nShe's my sexy cyber girl\nCyber, sexy cyber\nSexy cyber, I love her\nSexy cyber, sexy cyber\nShe's my sexy cyber girl7Embed"

Rap niggas trying act like they punk rock\nTight jeans, Mohawks screaming \u201cfuck cops\u201d\nY'all should get your fucking nuts chopped\nYou all look like you suck cock\nBust shots if you hate me\nYup that'll fix the problem\nPut me out there, leave it up to Mr. Goblin\nTo contribute to all the bullshit that's dropping\nSo he can take his kids out Christmas shopping\nLook at the niggas I'm spinning circles around\nMy verbal profound lyrics make them hurdle the town\nThey washed up 'til they gurgle and drown\nTheir whole dynasty I'm burning it down\nFunk Volume, you've heard of it now\n[Chorus]\nI kick the bitches out\nAnd let the girls in\nYour baby daddy shouts\nYou stole my girlfriend\nYou see I'm on the prowl\nI make the world spin, round\nWelcome to the pain in my life\nYeah baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nSuicide, (huh?) trust I might\nTell 'em what my motto is fuck my life\nDon't need alcohol to upper-cut my wife\nSo much rage I could crush my mic\nSee I woke up on the wrong side of the bed\nMy brain works but the whole left side of it is dead\nThere's a little small gremlin inside of my head\nAnd lately I've been feeling like I'm living life on the edge\nBut wait a minute, this ain't a gimmick, I can't pretend it\nI'ma scream it loud to the world just in case they forget it\nBe careful of some of the knowledge that you take from critics\nThey tryin' to execute a nigga but I stay committed\nNew topic, mind over matter\nNever needed my arms to climb up a ladder\nYou wack niggas don't ever show signs of a rapper\nIt's getting too serious for you? Why, what's the matter yo?\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI kick the bitches out\nAnd let the girls in\nYour baby daddy shouts\nYou stole my girlfriend\nYou see I'm on the prowl\nI make the world spin, round\nWelcome to the pain in my life\nYeah baby\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, the black man's back\nThere is no topic my raps can't smash\nThe state of hip hop that can't pass\nIt's all full of shit like a fat man's ass (eww)\nMay I please have just enough trust\nIn you motherfuckers to leave the rust of us stuck\nI turn my head and now you're messing stuff up\nAll that \"You! Turn it up!\" Just shut the fuck up\n(Damn) I'm rude and I'm so wicked\nI'll make sure you never blow up\nLike a balloon with a hole in it\nI knock hustlers for a living, got muscles for the women\nGot puzzles for the children, blaow\nPlus I got a sick delivery, that'll have you niggas shivering\nAnd stunned from bombs I drop lyrically\nYou can't touch my shit\nSo I'ma end it just like this\nSuck my dick!\n[Chorus]\nI kick the bitches out\nAnd let the girls in\nYour baby daddy shouts\nYou stole my girlfriend\nYou see I'm on the prowl\nI make the world spin, round\nWelcome to the pain in my life\nYeah babyEmbed"

Sometimes I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s up with you\nBut you already knowing that my love is true, been saving it up just for you\n\n[Verse 2]\nSee I respect you, I expect respect likewise\nI played the dumb guy once, I played the dumb guy twice\nNobody knows my strife, I never chose my life\nThere\u2019s never no highlights in this twisted cold twilight\nIll be damned if you contribute stress to my worries\nMy hearts on its last limb, so it\u2019s destined to hurt me\nMy last girlfriend screwed me and left in a hurry\nAnd ignores all my phone calls just to disturb me\nSo be completely honest, is love what your focus is\nOr should I pull my dick out right now and get it over with?\nIs that what you want? Is that what you need?\nWant me to pound your fucking ass till you bleed\nThe blast a few seeds, up in your coochie\nCome on, you can\u2019t bullshit a bullshitter\nAnd bitches wonder why I rap like a cruel nigga\nI need a woman who\u2019s amazing that can do right\nUntil then I guess that ill be gazing at the moonlight\n\n[Hook]\nAnd there are souls who cover up and choose to move further (further)\nIf I find that you fucking around I swear to God bitch you gon\u2019 be murdered (murdered)\nDo you wanna die tonight? Sometimes I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s up with you\nBut you already knowing that my love is true, been saving it up just for you\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nYou probably think I\u2019m buzzing, raw, angry and rugged\nAww maybe he\u2019s thuggin\u2019 but that\u2019s how crazy my love is\nI\u2019m a dedicated romance brother whose been played\nWay to many times now I\u2019m resorting to switch blades\nSo if I say I love you, more than likely I mean it\nNext time I write an agreement for stupid trifling reasons\nTo dare to fight and the screaming a better life's what I\u2019m seeking\nHow come bitches now-a-days never try to be decent?\nI never even used to use the word bitch\nAnd every chick I ever called it fucking deserved it, they earned it\nI\u2019m the type of guy your parents want you to marry\nI ain\u2019t no mother fucking mind freak that haunts you who\u2019s scary\nBut when I\u2019m getting fucked over, that all changes\nI get dangerous, my mind turns oh so shameless\nAnd my veins just, pop out my head I\u2019m real anxious\nTo show you the true definition of what pain is, bitch\n\n[Hook]\nAnd there are souls who cover up and choose to move further (further)\nIf I find that you fucking around I swear to God bitch you gon\u2019 be murdered (murdered)\nDo you wanna die tonight? Sometimes I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s up with you\nBut you already knowing that my love is true, been saving it up just for you\nAnd there are souls who cover up and choose to move further (further)\nIf I find that you fucking around I swear to God bitch you gon\u2019 be murdered (murdered)\nDo you wanna die tonight?

(Shit, bitch)\nWhat you taking me for?\nI guess a joke is what it must be\nI call you bitch then I call you ugly\nBecause you don't fucking love me\nThe things I do for you, you don't appreciate it\nEvery night I'm up I keep debatin'\nWhether or not I should call up your phone or leave you alone\nThis type of shit'll stay alive buried deep in my bones\nBut you don't even notice that\nAssuming you don't even know the facts\nFuck you I'm tired of holdin' back\nMy whole life I've been so nice and that's no lie\nGirl yo' ass is faking with me and I know why\nCause you don't love me\n[Chorus]\nI can sense that fake in you\nEvery time I look in your eyes (Your eyes; It's cause you)\nI don't believe that you love me (No)\nI don't believe that you love me (No)\nI can sense that fake in you\nAnd deep down baby I know why (Know why; It's cause you)\nI don't believe that you love me (No)\nI don't believe that you love me (No)\n\n[Bridge]\nLove, love, love, love, love, love\nOh, why ain't you real with me, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nI really wanna solve this but not with violence\nIt's like if we wanna fix things I gotta be the one who apologizes\nAnd that's not the way it should be, I ain't a rookie\nYou got the game twisted up, take a look and see\nI even made you a song on various albums\nNow I'm like \"Fuck a bitch, I'll do better without one\"\nYou ain't gotta be with Hopsin (Why?)\nI know I made a hell of a impact upon your life, I'll never be forgotten\nBut you will soon as I finish this song cause you've getting upper hands and that shit is just wrong\nMy feelings were strong, it's time for me to really move on\nThe feelings is gone cause you don't really feel me no more (Fuck it)\nIt's yo' loss so bitch so long\nYou ain't gonna stress my ass, oh no\nBe straight with me I'll be straight with you\nBut since you fake with me I got hate for you\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI can sense that fake in you\nEvery time I look in your eyes (Your eyes; It's cause you)\nI don't believe that you love me (No)\nI don't believe that you love me (No)\nI can sense that fake in you\nAnd deep down baby I know why (Know why; It's cause you)\nI don't believe that you love me (No)\nI don't believe that you love me (No)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm tired of saying fuck a ho then always being gullible\nIt done happened so much I'm thinking it's uncontrollable\nI'm screaming \"I don't give a fuck\" all the sudden\nI'm driving to pick her up even though this bitch is nuts\nI don't even get a trust ring, I just keep gettin' stuck\nBut shit I done seen enough, man fuck I should beat her up\nNah, cause if I did that then I'mma get mad\nAnd wish that I hadn't a did that so I just deal with this crap\nBut I ain't dealing with it ever again\nYour problems only turn me into the cleverest man\nNo settlin' in with you, rather settle with sins\nFor the rest of my life they go to the devil instead\nThese levels have spread way further than I had imagined it\nI should've blew you off when I had a chance at it\nBut no, I was dumb I had to grab the shit\nTried to show you love and now disaster hit\n[Chorus]\nI can sense that fake in you\nEvery time I look in your eyes (Your eyes; It's cause you)\nI don't believe that you love me (No)\nI don't believe that you love me (No)\nI can sense that fake in you\nAnd deep down baby I know why (Know why; It's cause you)\nI don't believe that you love me (No)\nI don't believe that you love me (No)3Embed"

Stop gobbling liquor and probably consider\nPlottin' some shit up to get popular quicker\nPhonies get too many plays on the station\nAnd leave me assed out of a deal while they on vacation\nShit I'll leave these rappers face on the pavement!\nThis game's filled with more whack niggas then a slave owner's basement\nBut I'm a freth of bresh air\nI mean a breath of fresh air\nMCs are next to catch hell\nI leave 'em wrecked and then scared\nCause that's just what I do\nI'm the lyrical bugaboo\nWait on me for a substitute\nI be tearin' shit up so move!\n\n[Hook]\nOhh, I'm here!\nSo open up the door for me\n(who is it?)\nIt's Hopsin\nI'm Here\nSo open up the door for me\nHurry up and let me in\n(Na Na Na Na Na)\nGive me my dinner\n(Na Na Na Na Na)\nThen pass me the dessert\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nHey shorty, if I buy you a 40\nYou think that you can gimme some 'tang? I'm feeling horny\nOr we can have an orgy\nWith you and your friends, I'll be the man\nHave a nigga yelling out, YEAH!\nMy label trying make me switch the flow\nJust because Oprah don't want me saying bitch no more\nI'm like \"Oprah, why you doing this?\nCome on, this is ludacris\nThat just hypes my ass up even more to call YOU a bitch!\"\nThis is my life, and this is my urge\nThis is my mic, and these are my words\nYou can't stop Hopsin\nForget it, its not poppin\nI kick the shit that niggas love when they hot boxin\nRight when you was bout to retire from listenin rap music\nI reversed and turned you back to it\nIt was a close call\nI was even thinkin all hope was lost but most of all\nBe happy\n\n[Hook]\nOhh, I'm here!\nSo open up the door for me\n(who is it?)\nIt's Hopsin\nI'm Here\nSo open up the door for me\nHurry up and let me in\n(Na Na Na Na Na)\nGive me my dinner\n(Na Na Na Na Na)\nThen pass me the dessert\n[Verse 3]\nI go to rap concerts, and post in the back\nDon't even clap, I'm knowing that the show'll be wack\nAfter performing they be looking like they s'posed to get dap\nI'm like, \"Man, you got murdered by your opening act, get outta here\nYou ain't fucking with what I brought to the table\nYou just a tax write-off for your label, you outside flossing you Range Rove\nHoes eyeballing your bankroll\n'Til you flopping all the money back\nAm I watchin' the same show? I think so\"\nI'm the invincible, unpredictable, Mr. Ripper flow\nYes, it's pitiful, gimme some nipples to nibble on\nLyrical general, suck on my genitals\n'Fore you get shitted on\nUnderstand me or we never gon' get along\nHe best be, the hottest since the PS3\nStraight out the W-E-S-T\nOf course! What other rappers you know repping it iller?\nYou other niggas pretty hot but I'm a definite killer\n\n[Hook]\nOhh, I'm here!\nSo open up the door for me\n(who is it?)\nIt's Hopsin\nI'm Here\nSo open up the door for me\nHurry up and let me in\n(Na Na Na Na Na)\nGive me my dinner\n(Na Na Na Na Na)\nThen pass me the dessert\nOhh, I'm here!\nSo open up the door for me\n(who is it?)\nIt's Hopsin\nI'm Here\nSo open up the door for me\nHurry up and let me in\n(Na Na Na Na Na)\nGive me my dinner\n(Na Na Na Na Na)\nThen pass me the dessert\n\n[Outro]\nHopsin!\nHopsin!\nHopsin!\nHopsin!\nHopsin!\nHopsin!\nHopsin!\nHopsin!\nHopsin!\nHopsin!\nH-izzo, P stepped in the dizzo\nWit' a mean mug and a magnificent flizzo\nH-izzo, P stepped in the dizzo\nWit' a mean mug and a magnificent flizzo2Embed"

Fuck it. I'll fight you\nYou stupid as your dumb fan puppets you lie to\nTelling them all that Lil wayne wanted to sign you\nBullshit thats a bunch of crap\nTheres no proof Wayne gave you a contract\nWhats up with that?\nAnd if he did put one up for grabs\nYou turned it down cause he wouldn't kiss you like he does his dad\nFuckin' fag back down or get burnt quick\nYou like the confidence I gave you on first diss?\nIt was on purpose, I knew if I threw the first hit you'd respond\nNow I'll prove that you ain't worth shit\n\nAm I a beast? Of course it is true\nI strangle Novi in his booth\nUsing his mic cord as a noose\nBoard up your room, you're doomed\nBy my whole rep of tunes\nAnd soon\nYour fans gonn' turn on you\nLike some wicked goons\n\nI don't care to pull your card, you deserve it\nYou're the reason white rappers have it so hard\nYou actin' tougher than a\nNappy afro that won't part, but you're like a mannequin, all body with no heart\nYour whole game is whack, Novi Novak?\nC'mon, be real.. what kinda name is that?\nYou a shameless act, who's lame, infact\nYou try to gain fame\nPretend like you were raised with blacks\n\nBlack psychos? You're glad I can't be called that\nI'm only crazy over Raw tracks\nBut you ain't nuts either nigga, so fall back\nClosest thing you ever been to nuts is lickin' your daddy's ballsack\nYou might also likeYou bullshittin' sayin' Hop sucks\nYou smoke a lot, but I'm one hit of dope you should not puff\nYa I heard your diss, it was hot stuff\nI see you Googled my name\nI tried yours, nothing popped up\nYou act like you the hugest star\nYou strung out like a used guitar\nYou couldn't get a hit standing in front of a moving car\nThe only time you tour is at an amusement park\n\nStop denying it you can't hold me\nThe flow is nastier than anchovies\nDon't be up at my show in Chicago tryna act like you my damn homie\nFuck Swag City followers, and Novi1Embed"

Why? 'Cause I'm super duper fly\nHey, I'm so fly (Fly)\nLook at me flyin' away (Ooh)\n(I can fly, I can fly) Hey\n(I can fly, I can fly) Hey (I can fly) Uh-huh\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow the bomb is lit, flow is one word: astonishing\nBecoming different, changin' it up is what I\u2019m promising\nYeah you got potential and all a that but you not as sick\nSomeone tell these low, down, and dirty fuckers who Hopsin is\nIt's been awhile, feels like five hundred years\nBut the apocalypse is finally here, a lot of these queers\nJust run around thinking that they hot but they cold as fuck\nWhen I drop that shit gon' be over and y'all gon' know wassup\nNiggas acting like that they hate to show love\n'Til they find out what I'm capable of\nI'm finna fizz up like baking soda, put so much pressure on you niggas you'll be forced to exit the game, 'cause my games is so tough\nBut you muthafuckas is probably gon' keep on coming back like roaches\nBut I have the potion, I'll eat you just like a pack of vultures\n'Cause I rap ferocious, y'all lack emotion that's needed in this\nI bees the business so what can I say, I just need to win it\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI got some flows and they super duper nice\nJust gimme a dope beat and I'll be super duper tight\nLace it up, sell it for a super duper price\nWhy? Why? 'Cause I'm super duper fly\nHey, I'm so fly (Fly)\nLook at me flyin' away (Ooh)\n(I can fly, I can fly) Hey\n(I can fly, I can fly) Hey (I can fly) Uh-huh\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy image doesn\u2019t appear to be vicious\nBut just by hearin' me rip this\nI'm sure that you could tell I'm lyrically gifted\nIt's a conspiracy, is it?\nDefinitely, if you step to diss me\nI'll make sure you restin\u2019 in peace, switch a mic, I wreck an emcee\nEvidently I'm known to killers, the devil in me\nYou can tell it's in me, my flow has been mastered elegantly\nIf you fellas tip me it's 'cause you feelin' the jealous envy\nNext I put more thought in it before you sell ya cd\nI wouldn't say that I'm the father of rap, but raps father died so I just adopted his ass\nSince none a y'all will take him in, watch what I'ma make of him\nThe nigga finna be the muthafuckin' hottest thing again\nY'all been treatin' the game wrong, man Hopsin ain't ya friend\nI ain't taking back none of my words, fuck who they offend\nY'all claimin' that y'all niggas from the hood and the streets\nThen why's the motherfuckin' game Hollywood as can be?\n[Chorus]\nI got some flows and they super duper nice\nJust gimme a dope beat and I'll be super duper tight\nLace it up, sell it for a super duper price\nWhy? Why? 'Cause I'm super duper fly\nHey, I'm so fly (Fly)\nLook at me flyin' away (Ooh)\n(I can fly, I can fly) Hey\n(I can fly, I can fly) Hey (I can fly) Uh-huh6Embed"

(Nope)\nAnd even got no drive for dope\nI'm looked upon like I'm a joke\n'Cause this the shit that I promote\nThe Ill Mind Of Hopsin!\nWhere real life's an option!\nThe ill lines that I spit make you realize you're not sick!\nScience at its finest tell Bill Nye to watch it\nNow turn this shit the fuck up 'til you feel high and nauseous\nYou fake thug rappers be frontin' like you was born with Glocks (I trap niggas)\nBut only time you ever bang is when the door is locked (C'mon!)\nNigga with attitude just without the S curl\nI break rappers like promises with my ex girl\nI'm kinda strange\nAnd I been this way since a young age\nThe biggest book I've read was less than one page\nI've always had slump grades\nNever use a condom like I want AIDS\nA nutcase, I'll smash your fuckin' dreams like a pugs face\n[Hook]\nI'm a high school drop out\nStill living at my moms house (My moms house) (Oh yeah!)\nI talk shit and get knocked out\nMy life sucks and I'm not proud\nOhhh do you wanna be my friend\nI would love to be your friend\nCome on then\nDo you wanna be my friend\nI would love to be your friend\nCome on then\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy life's lame, I gotta pay money to fuck a whore\nI couldn't pull a damn anorexic bitch in a tug of war\nI'm sick of big headed niggas feeling above the lord\nSomebody please give Soulja Boy the \"You Suck\" award!\nOut of all the styles you just had to pick the wack shit\nHopsin won't attack you if you practice\nYou faggot little bastard\nI never would have imagined this would happen\nI should fuckin' power drive your ass into a cactus\nYo, the game's mine, go rule you own\nI got a foolish zone\nI'm a schitzo who carpools alone\nRelax this is the music that I make for maniacs\nWho can't adapt with the rest, now watch the chain react\nThe world's cold, open your mouth and let me come inside\nI diss the fuck outta rappers, it's 'cause I wanna die\nI never face my problems\nShit I always run from mine\nI fucked my life up, now I'm tryin' to give your son a try\nYou might also like[Hook]\nI'm a high school drop out\nStill living at my moms house (My moms house) (Oh yeah!)\nI talk shit and get knocked out\nMy life sucks and I'm not proud\nOhhh do you wanna be my friend\nI would love to be your friend\nCome on then\nDo you wanna be my friend\nI would love to be your friend\nCome on then\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, I come from a land where the kids fail to sick hell\nSo if you're frightened by my lyrics and looks bitch, yell\nBrainwashed, by Slim Shady and D12\nCrooked, Ludacris, Missy Elliot, Big L\nWell, y'all know Hopsin, but let me explain who Marcus is\nI make inspiration on music for the retarded kids\nWho suffer from Parkinson's\nWhose bodies have parts missin'\n'Cause it's Special Ed, man you really don't know how hard it is\nYou know I've always been a know-it-all\nI thought that when I'd grow up tall\nI'd get pussy and not be using blow up dolls\nI want more hoes\nI can't control my hormones\nI'm always watchin' pornos in my bedroom with the door closed\nWhoa! Hey Hopsin!\nStop with the mental hacker games\nYou've already brainwashed our son, Alexander James (What?)\nHe's only half your age (So?), and now he masturbates\nHis whole perspective on the things that really matter changed (Man!)\n[Hook]\nI'm a high school drop out\nStill living at my moms house (My moms house) (Oh yeah!)\nI talk shit and get knocked out\nMy life sucks and I'm not proud\nOhhh do you wanna be my friend\nI would love to be your friend\nCome on then\nDo you wanna be my friend\nI would love to be your friend\nCome on then1Embed"

You had me acting like a fool\nTrapped inside your loop because you\u2019re scared to sacrifice the truth?\nCome on, how many niggas you really fuck with?\nHow many time you really suck dick?\nQuit lyin\u2019 to me you dumb prick\n\n[Hook]\nDon\u2019t trust \u2018em\nDon\u2019t you ever, ever trust a ho\nDon\u2019t trust \u2018em\nDon\u2019t trust \u2018em\nDon\u2019t you ever, ever, ever, ever, trust a ho\n\u2018Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin\u2019\nThey\u2019ll slip right under your surface\nOoh ooh ooh they be lyin\u2019\nWhat have I done to deserve this?\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nI\u2019ll never find love, screw it, fuck it\nBeen through enough shit\nThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 you bitches can do to go renew your justice\nI\u2019m too disgusted and I\u2019m tired of being played with\nYou should have thought about all this prior to the occasion\nYou fucked around, thought for a while you was amazing\n'Til I got the pieces and piled up the equation\nHad a nigga goin\u2019 in and out your crotch\nNot knowin\u2019 this little skank done been around the block\nA year later out the blue we having trust issues\nAfter I already fell in love with you\nCome to think of it the image does fit you\nYou fucked every nigga on the thug menu\nAnd I\u2019m the dumb kid who\nThinks he found his soul mate, he\u2019s blinded by the light\n'Til it goes dim, now his hand is right beside a knife\nA violent type of life is what society offers\nMan, why even bother?\nJust remember\n\n[Hook]\nDon\u2019t trust \u2018em\nDon\u2019t you ever, ever trust a ho\nDon\u2019t trust \u2018em\nDon\u2019t trust \u2018em\nDon\u2019t you ever, ever, ever, ever, trust a ho\n\u2018Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin\u2019\nThey\u2019ll slip right under your surface\nOoh ooh ooh they be lyin\u2019\nWhat have I done to deserve this?\n[Bridge]\nThey\u2019ll hide their colors from ones they wanna love\nEven if you ask her, more than likely she ain\u2019t gonna tell\nBeen through this too many times, so take it from me, ooh take it from me!\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo if you about to fall in love you need to think twice on it\n\u2018Cause girls are triflin\u2019, they\u2019ll start lyin\u2019 when they invite you in\nHave you feeling like the man; you think you found a keeper\nGirls have said they love you; but when she say it, the sound is sweeter\nYour love drowning deeper, now she\u2019s acting like she smoking pounds of reefer\nConfessing that whole fuckin\u2019 town done beefed her\nThen you like \u201cI left this bitch with my heart, she ripped it apart\nI should have seen this from the start\u201d\nThe shit you and her go and do it sounds nice\nBut the fact remains, you don\u2019t turn a ho into a housewife\nThat\u2019s what the fuck I did, and I regretted it, that\u2019s why I\u2019m negative\nNo medicine could get rid of this\nThe next bitch who lies to me, watch me damage her\nI\u2019m pickin\u2019 her up and body slamin\u2019 her\nAnd that\u2019s real, so if you think your girls a ho but you didn\u2019t witness it\nAssume she\u2019s a ho, 'til proven innocent\nAnd just remember\n\n[Hook]\nDon\u2019t trust \u2018em\nDon\u2019t you ever, ever trust a ho\nDon\u2019t trust \u2018em\nDon\u2019t trust \u2018em\nDon\u2019t you ever, ever, ever, ever, trust a ho\n\u2018Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin\u2019\nThey\u2019ll slip right under your surface\nOoh ooh ooh they be lyin\u2019\nWhat have I done to deserve this?\n\n[Outro]\nFuck love, Don\u2019t hate me\nHate these lying ass bitches for making me make you hate me1Embed"

Like, like one of the cool ones?\nMan I got to go man I'm not tryin to sing...\nPlease?\nAlright, alright alright...\n\n[Hook]\nIt's the B Bop, my B Bop song\nDo the B Bop, ain't nothing wrong\nCome on!\nShobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!\nShobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!\n[Verse 1: Hopsin]\nAyo it's time to bring the West back, pass me the exlax\nSo I can shit on all these niggas when I wreck tracks\nYour flow ain't that ill, I think you should adjust that\nHomie I don't mean to be rude to you, it's just that\nYou ain't the first nigga I seen with an attitude\nUp on the mic tryin' to explain what the gat'll do\nYour skills won't get you that place up in Malibu\nYou better off tryin' to go slang with a bag of fruit\nAnd leave it up to me, I got the bubblies\nI'll do in an hour what would take your ass a couple days\nMy contacts make the ladies fall in love with me\nHe's the joker of rap is what these motherfuckers say\nI'm slightly psychotic and idiotic but modest whenever spotted\nSo logically I'm a prophet, face it niggas you just suck\nAnd as far as your game, it ain't never had legs to step up\n\n[Hook]\nIt's the B Bop, my B Bop song\nDo the B Bop, ain't nothing wrong\nCome on!\nShobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!\nShobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!\n\n[Verse 2: Hopsin]\nMan I'm tired of the ghetto, hope I make it out this place\nIll niggas running around like an ape up out the cage\nAnd it ain't about the change, man these things are not the same\nAll these killers wanna leave my brain laying on the pave\nAnd I ain't did nothing, all these little kids cussing\nLearning from their big cousins how to go and get stuck in\nA correctional facility, messing up their liberty\nActing a fool making unnecessary enemies\nYes it's very weird to me, I did not get caught in it\nI was into rap, for some reason I love the art of it\nI ain't never drank or smoked because I'm smarter than\nThat and I didn't want to grow up to be what my father is\nGotta make a living, got plans of moving out the hood, not stayin in it\nI hate these cheap apartments, and these vague complaining attendants\nRoaches in the kitchen but I ain't really trippin, I'll be rolling in a minute, singin\nYou might also like[Hook]\nIt's the B Bop, my B Bop song\nDo the B Bop, ain't nothing wrong\nCome on!\nShobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!\nShobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!\n\n[Verse 3: Hopsin]\nOn the mic I burn niggas and turn rappers to singers\nI learn that on the day I confirmed I was the slayer\nI serve packs of these haters my words actually rape 'em\nAnd where's daddy to save him? My urge has to be fatal\nUp in this music shit the sky's the limit for rising in it\nLong as I'm consistent and keep on using my eyes as gimmicks\nI'mma be the talk of the town, walking around\nLike \"Yes this rap game, I'm the boss of it now\"\n\n[Hook]\nIt's the B Bop, my B Bop song\nDo the B Bop, ain't nothing wrong\nCome on!\nShobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!\nShobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!1Embed"

Lyrics[Intro]\nToday's Thursday November 7th, 2013\nAnd I'm fed up with doin' all of this business Hopsin Knock Madness shit, man\nFuck this rap game\n\n[Hook]\nI swear to God I'm feelin' so sick (so sick)\nIt's like I don't know where my home is (home is)\nA nigga gone, you can see it in my eyes\nI ain't even got the strength to fucking cry\nSo tell me if you can find me\nWhere'd I go? Have you seen me?\nI don't know\nYou see I used to think that my money would bring me happiness and\nNow I can't believe this is happening, where did I go?\n[Verse]\nA nigga feel gone, lost, ain't got no purpose\nSpent a year locked in churches\nTrying to jot the verses\nBut I'm stuck with these rotten curses\nEvery time I rap you can hear the pain burn through\n'Cause I never had a real family to turn to\nI got shit on my nerves\nTo give me the urge\nTo yell curse words but I'm really tryin' to learn to keep it all under control\nBut I can't 'cause I'm stuck in a hole\nThe devil tryna puppet my soul\nMaking me a slave to the game, taking away my joys and then handing me a bucket of gold\nNo! I don't want it no more\nTake these groupies, I ain't fucking your whores\nImagine being fed when your stomache don't roar\nI wake up every morning and in a rugged cold war\nFuck my life, the fuck am I doin', man?\nHopsin, you're the man, I love all your songs I'm like a really big fan\nIssues occured and started back in high school when I used to get beat on\nNow I hide myself with contacts and the fame's a drug I OD on\n\n[Hook]\nI swear to God I'm feelin' so sick (so sick)\nIt's like I don't know where my home is (home is)\nA nigga gone, you can see it in my eyes\nI ain't even got the strength to fucking cry\nSo tell me if you can find me\nWhere'd I go? Have you seen me?\nI don't know\nYou see I used to think that my money would bring me happiness and\nNow I can't believe this is happening, where did I go?\nYou might also like[Outro]\nThis is not on my album...\nI just made it today 'cause I just needed to vent...and talk\nSittin' in this fucking basement, it driving me crazy...\nSigh...I'm weird now, I can honestly say that I'm fucking weird, I have changed\nBut I didn't go Hollywood...I don't know what the hell I - I don't know, man2Embed"

Giving me this mediocre lifestyle\nIf I'ma get it then what needs to happen right now\nI'm one week away from jumping off a cliff\nOr putting heat up to my head, and then dumping off a clip\nI know you think I'm just lying, 'cause last time\nI stood next to a cliff side, I bitched out but I'ma do it this time\nMan forget it, we both know I'm not\nI just say that stupid shit because I'm so low on guap\nBut for real though, God man you've got to help me out\n'Cause I know the road I'm rolling on is not a healthy route\nFrom now back to the day I was a little kid\nShit ain't even brighten up a little bit\nNow wouldn't you be just a little pissed if this was you\nYeah I'm cursed and it's the truth\nLooks like I'ma have to resort to violence to get the loot\n\n[Chorus]\nY'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P\nI'ma tell y'all a story of mine about how the lord put the weight on me (that's right)\nY'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P\nThank you for listening to my story (alright)2Embed"

My mom got me Mercedes keys\" (Woah)\nAnd I'ma lie and be like \"Yeah, that shit is great ya see\nBut to be honest, Christmas is just another day to me\" (I see)\nI'ma be mad 'cause his parents rich and my parents not (So?)\nHe gets cars, I get pairs of socks\nI'm always gettin' treated unfair a lot, this Christmas, I ain't havin' fun\nOur tree ain't even real, it's a detachable plastic one (No way)\nMy dad gon' come with his cheap watch that he got me\nFrom the swap meet, and if I ask him if it's real, he'll say \"Probably\" (Oh)\nMan Dad, do you have no heart? You couldn't get me a go kart\nOr a Tyco RC remote control car? (Chillax)\nHe gon' be like \"There you go makin' this noise\nI done told yo ass you too old to playin' with toys\"\nThen my mom gon' walk in the room and start arguin' too\nMy dad gon' be like \"Go woman, nobody talkin' to you\" (Wow)\nAnd I'ma say \"Dad you love talking mad shit\nBut in public you always act like you above causing havoc? (No way)\nThen I'ma run upstairs, mad as fuck 'cause I've had it\nProbably masturbate while watching Spongebob and Patrick (Ew)\nI don't know\nYou might also like[Chorus: Hopsin]\nHey Mom, Dad\nWhat did you get me for\nChristmas?\nHey Mom, Dad\nI said what did you get me for\nChristmas?\n\n[Outro: Hopsin]\nFuck man, stupid ass Christmas, man\nThat shit used to be fun when I was little\nNow that shit is wack as fuck, man\nTurned into a grown ass man now\nStupid ass real life shit, man, Damn!2Embed"

(Aaah)\nEven if you did it wouldn't make a difference\n'Cause the people you tryna attract ain't listenin'\nThese bubbly wubblys suddenly buggin' me\nStomach be rumblin' mumblin' when I have to confront MCs\nIt troubles me but the honeys be lovin' me\nSome will be fiesty, but in the end I'ma feel on her double Ds\nI'ma have to end this dang song pretty soon\nAnd I ain't sayin' it just to be cool I really do\nFor real man, all my dang time is runnin' out\nOh too late, it's already comin' out!\n\n[Hook:]\n[Outro:]\nI've been waiting for this my whole life\nOh yes, the feelin' is so right\nYeah, yeah, bubblies\nHuh, hah, ooh thank God yeah\nBubblies, haha1Embed"

No\nOnce these wack MCs find out I crucify souls\nThey'll be calling the number on Logic's suicide songYou might also likeEmbed"

(come on man)\nYou want the truth on if your progress is good naaw\nYou think you cute cause you shit talkin and look tall\nNigga your neck looks like you swallowed a football\nFuck yo dick my cock is a foot long\nMe fallin off is kinda like you droppin a good song. (never)\nSo quit rappin stop messin' with me\nYo big buff ass belongs on a wrestling team man\nSo see me in Chicago faggot you'll be boo'd oh wit bruised bones\nEither that or sent to your new home (PEACE)\nAnd I'll be up at your funeral widda suit on\nNext to ya momma who suckin' my dick behind yo tomb stone\nYou got no time for diss tracks or broke computers\nCause you busy workin wit these multi-platinum producers\nFuck Novi hes a faggot and a loser\nIm swagin' on his future\nIt's like sickin a dragon on a rooster\nFace facts, you dont have any thug signs\nI know it cause you smile after all of your punchlines\nI woulda personally dragged your ass to the morgue\nBut if I showed up to your house, YOU WOULDNT ANSWER THE DOOR\nSo shut the fuck up. \"You might also likeEmbed"

That's a fatal attempt to do!\"\nYou thinking you spit the truth, I shake you and strip your jewels\nThen hang you up from a roof, and strangle you with a noose\nCremate you with four torches, flame of the torch scorching\nLeaving your corpse tortured of course it's hardcore shit\nAnd if there's ever a day that my pockets hurting\nI'm robbing you, with a Osama Bin Laden turban\nHip-Hop is urging for a new flock of verses to rock the circuit\nAll you flops emerging are pitiful, we did not deserve it\nYour style ain't even worth the fame\nIt's watered down more than New Orleans during a hurricane\nYour whole album was a verbal shame\nI'm Hopsin, don't act like you ain't heard the nameYou might also like3Embed"

Fuck a cage, I'ma break through\nGhetto, still sipping grape juice, who should I put the flame to?\nIf you hand me the throne just make sure it comes with a cape too\nThe only nigga with shit on lock is Hopsin, it ain't you\nWhen I'm up to bat man, my only option is Babe Ruth\nI never give into you incompetent lame dudes\nI buss you in your fucking head with a bottle of Grey Goose\nAnd I done lost myself, be happy? I don't know how to\nThe sunny days that I forgot to cherish are now blue\nNigga if you were me for while you would understand\nIf money doesn't change you, it'll change the ones around you\nSo I been ducking low, tryna hibernate and just find my way\nI've been gassing, I gotta find the breaks 'til my mind is straight\nI'm showing signs of hate 'cause I'm trapped in a darkness I embraced\nLook me in my eyes, you could tell I'm ready to die today\nIf you see me then don't come over\nI can't control my actions or emotions, the Devil's got the remote control an'\nStyle is cold and vulgar, got no composure\nDefeating me is like tackling a juggernaut with some broken shoulders\nSo don't provoke, this is deadly and isn't user friendly\n'Cause I own up to any truth you try to use against me\nSince high school I've been known to be an abusive MC\nI never stop the madness until I see you surrender\nWelcome to Savageville, where shit ain't average\nIt's madness, imagine a pack a stragglers swinging from chandeliers\nI'm in a Cavalier with a thot who drank a six-pack of beers\nGetting road head and she's driving, the fuck is happening here?\nI ain't calm and peaceful, nah, my small cerebral\nIs often evil, better hide like Doctor Jekyll's alter ego\nCall your people, I'm mad as addicts who lost the needle\nDon't buy my album because it's all illegal, too off to be on\nI'm talking Sm\u00e9agol, I launch torpedoes, bitch, I'm the dirtbag\nThat ran up on wearing a Purge mask when you got your purse snatched\nHere's your one way ticket to Hell in first class\nY'all all be making my nerves spaz, my word craft will make you disperse cash\nI'm the special ed nigga you ignored, y'all the motherfuckers that I do it for\nWhen I step inside the booth I'm lighting everything on fire like I was the Human Torch\nWhooping ass, kicking through the door, spewing gore, breaking windows of your new Accord\nAnyone who ever left better not be coming back to try to build a new rapport\nI'm wild rude, a foul dude, I prowl through\nI step on the mic and all the sudden my bowels move\nCatching bodies? I'm 'bout to\nI'm the one you should bow to, you niggas is ass, trash, cow poo\nStyle's based off pure vengeance, I'm a fierce engine\nYou'll get rear-ended, there's weird tension, my peers sense it\nI'm a feared misfit, a geared henchman, you scared senseless\nIt's tear-drenching, but you'll be hooked after a mere sentence\n[Outro: Hopsin]\nAnd I'm out this bitch.

Baby let me know\nWe go together perfectly, the Cancer and the Leo, yeah!\nI ride for you like a soldier\nBaby all you gotta do is give me your love, yeah\nThe world can get to know us, show love\nIf you'll be my valentine\n[Outro]\nHappy Valentine's day Alyce. I hope you like this. Sorry I can't be there, I'm on my tour but, just letting you know that I'm thinking about you, and I want the world to know as well. PeaceYou might also like5Embed"

Okay, maybe\nI don\u2019t wanna turn this into the worst disaster\nI wanna live happily after, chilling with hella laughter\nBut you like the man on some crack\nThis shit led to the macs\nYou lucky that you ain\u2019t got hit in the head with a bat (Grrah)\nI\u2019m already knowing I\u2019m sorta psycho (Hahaha)\nBut you won\u2019t ever find another dude who loves you more than I do\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl you should feel like, somebody\u2019s watching you (Watching you, watching you)\nYou ain\u2019t got no privacy\nGirl you should feel like, somebody\u2019s watching you (Watching you, watching you)\nDon\u2019t be tryin' to hide from me\n[Verse 3]\nI used to make you nice old songs\nNow it\u2019s the psycho songs\nCause I\u2019m the dude that you don\u2019t like no more\nI was a nice a guy years ago\nNow you make me miserable\nI had to put this shit up on a track to let these niggas know, oh\n\n[Bridge]\nWhy do I feel like, police are watching me (Watching me, watching me)\nThere\u2019s nothing you can do to me\nWhy do I feel like, police are watching me (Watching me, watching me)\nYou don\u2019t have to look past it\u2019s me\n\n[Deputy Doyle]\nWe have subject Marcus Jamal Hopson in custody now\n\n[Hopsin]\nMan!\n\n[Commanding Officer]\nBring him to the station, Doyle! Now!\n\n[Hopsin]\nAw, man, hahahaha\nYou watch Tracey, hah, you won\u2019t get rid of me (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)\nI don\u2019t care how hard they try\nHow far you hide\nI know where you live, what car you drive (Hahaha)\nThis ain\u2019t the start of the end\nYou gonna see Marcus again, there's a no arguing friend\nI\u2019m gonna be given you prank calls from the pen\n\n[Deputy Doyle]\nYeah, right!\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl you should feel like, somebody\u2019s watching you (Watching you, watching you)\nYou ain\u2019t got no privacy\nGirl you should feel like, somebody\u2019s watching you (Watching you, watching you)\nDon\u2019t be tryin' to hide from me\nGirl you should feel like, somebody\u2019s watching you (Watching you, watching you)\nYou ain\u2019t got no privacy\nGirl you should feel like, somebody\u2019s watching you (Watching you, watching you)\nDon\u2019t be tryin' to hide from me\n\n[Outro]\nBut I love youEmbed"

I don't have to make no freakin' sense\nAnd only think I'm gettin over is your picket fence\nLast time we saw her was Saturday, She's been missing since!\nHmm, Maybe 'coz I stole her\nThat ho was bipolar\nI'm sick of skank ass bitches fuckin' my life over\nBut I dont hit girls, I sexually knock 'em up\nShe cheats on me, I chop her up\nFedEx come and box her up\nMe sayin \"Screw you, Don't call me again\" is not enough\nI'mma make you and your family suffer from alot of stuff\nDon't tell me to tone it down, motherfuckers, I gotta cuss\nWe'll never reunite, there's nothin' left I got for us\nWhat hurts the most is your family knew you were playin' me\nEverything we had was make believe\nI can't believe\nI fuckin' trusted you\nI shoulda never fucked with you\nNow you're gonna suffer the consequences, sucks for you\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro talking]You might also likeEmbed"

I just gobbled a big mac\nA bag of sour patch and now its time to take a dook\nAye yo Hop (whats up?) wheres the bathroom man? (why?)\nMy nigga, you should already know (know what?)\nIve got a monster in my tummy, its about to get ugly\nMotherfucker (what?) im about to blow\nI can feel it pokein' out like a nipple\nIts drippin' down my leg (eh) now its official\nI'mma need a double XL, some sprain a fanta, open the window\nLots of tissue, and a very large can\nFor a very large dump, its turning in my gut\nHop dawg forget about your shower, cancel our show\nI'mma need a couple hours\nYou might also like[Hook:]Embed"

I'm more than what I seem\n\n[Verse 1]\nOnce upon a time there was a boy named Mr. Pillowman\nHe had enough rage bottled inside to even kill a man\nAnd always went out of his way just so that he could get a friend\nHe'd ask for opportunities but nobody would give a damn\nAnd he would always hope he made it, cause he was so creative\nBut he was slowly hated going through these dopey mazes\nHe'd never hesitate whenever a test was given\nHe'd pass it with an A+ but get no recognition\nAt 19 years old he thought he caught his break\nAnd understood that patience and motivation is all it takes\nHis mother was so happy for him that she bought a cake\nI wish you could have seen the smile on his father's face\nTwo days after that, he was feeling lost and dazed\nThe man who was suppose to be his hookup was talking fake\nNow this is oftly strange, his world is cloudy as it softly rains\nAs he's crying out loud, his heart would sing...\n[Chorus]\nMr Pillowman, you can sleep on me. And i'll fulfill your dreams\nI'm the\nPillowman, you probably heard about me. I'm more than what I seem\n\n[Verse 2]\nMr Pillowman. Nothing but a civil man\nAlways felt that his success was just around the riverbend\nHe'd smile in your face but down in his heart he'd be sad\nThe world would never acknowledge half of the talents he had\n22 years old he thought he caught his break again\nBecause his buddy hooked him up, and it's for surely thanks to him\nThat Mr. Pilloman, is happy and so proud of his life\nWow this is nice, it's like he felt the power of Christ\nHe knew that God is good and God is bold, It's time to Rock and Roll\nSomebody finally understood he was a pot of gold\nHis lack of success was to the point where it's gotten old\nBut patience was the key, so the stories often told\n...Then his buddy called, and said \"I hate to tell you\nBut that connection that I hooked you up with never fell through\"\nThen Pillowman's like \"What the hell dude? You said this was a swell move\nI'm probably better off trying to sell shoes\"\n\n[Chorus]\nMr Pillowman, you can sleep on me. And i'll fulfill your dreams\nI'm the\nPillowman, you probably heard about me. I'm more than what I seem\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nHere's a secret. I am Mr. Pillowman\nGoing on 25 and I'm wishing I could live again\nI've reached out to people but yet nobody would lend a hand\nI feel like i'll never be able to pay my rent again\nI'm getting old and time is crucial, feels like I'm not as useful\nMy only meals consist of Kool-aid, and Ramen noodles\n...I wish I had more, but my mom and dad's poor\nSo when you see me don't bother to ask me what I'm mad for\n..Yeah you can laugh about it. But I'm just sad and pouting\nSeeing motherfuckers make it who don't have no talent\nThat's 10 years of my life that's down the drain\nI feel like a true failure living life without a brain\nBut yo, I'm still trying to get a name\nRapping on the mic and spitting flames maybe i could get some change\nBut I'm at the point I'm about to say \"fuck it\"\nCause I released a nationwide album and I never made a buck from it\n\n[Chorus]\nMr Pillowman, you can sleep on me. And i'll fulfill your dreams\nI'm the\nPillowman, you probably heard about me. I'm more than what I seem2Embed"

The bad kid is back bitch\nAnd I ain't doing schoolwork, I'm doing rap shit\nHopsin comin' after you, there's no way to stop him\nLAUSD don't do nothing but cause problems\nIf I ever get a chance to rob 'em\nI'ma just, fuck it next teacher I see I'll fuckin' sock him\nSo all you teachers better run for the border\nTryna tell me I got a fuckin' mental disorder\nThis goes out to every fuckin' teacher, I hate you\nI said it once and I'll say it again, I hate school\n\n[Hook]\nADHD, ADHD\nADHD, it's ADHD\nADHD, it's taking over me\nADHD-D-D\nADHD, ADHD\nADHD, it's ADHD\nADHD, it's taking over me\nADHD-D-D\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nNever in my life, did I think I would get it\nUntil the other day they told me, I was diagnosed wit' it\nFuck school it fucked up my life, it's time to quit it\nAnd I'll admit it, I never learned shit when I was in it\nLet me do whatever the fuck I wanna do\nI'll stab you in the head with a pencil, a number two\nIt's the ADHD, you can't tell what I'ma do\nI fuckin' mobbin' the school with straight bomb on you fools\nYou never answer my questions you pantomime\nAs a matter of fact bitches, fuck a Stanford-9\nWhy should I take it man, it's worthless\nThat's why every time I take it I always fail it on purpose\nLike I'ma waste my energy, tryna pass it\nJust hand me another test and see don't you get your ass kicked\nI'm not Batman, Spider Man or Heat-Man\nYou can just call me the ADHD man\n\n[Hook]\nADHD, ADHD\nADHD, it's ADHD\nADHD, it's taking over me\nADHD-D-D\nADHD, ADHD\nADHD, it's ADHD\nADHD, it's taking over me\nADHD-D-D\n[Verse 3]\nI wonder which one of my teachers even started this?\nTryna put me in the class, with all the retarded kids\nAnd I'm the only nigga up in there, I'm hard to miss\nI'm telling you man, one day I'ma just toss the fence\nAnd shoot it towards the teacher and crack his dome open\nBreak the locks in the door just so it won't open\nStomp his fuckin' face in until his nose broken\nI'm one hundred percent serious, no joking\nFuckin' teachers try to act like they reaching out\nThen they gon' talk about my ass in the teachers lounge\nI went up in there, went blasting every teacher found\nThey'll get they head bashed in 'til blood is leaking out (Bitches)\nEverything I did bad in class was intended\nSend me to the dean bitch, I wanna get suspended\nADHD, bitches I'm a lot smarter\nI'm just tryna make your motherfuckin' job harder\n\n[Hook]\nADHD, ADHD\nADHD, it's ADHD\nADHD, it's taking over me\nADHD-D-D\nADHD, ADHD\nADHD, it's ADHD\nADHD, it's taking over me\nADHD-D-D\n\nADHD, ADHD\nADHD, it's ADHD\nADHD, it's taking over me\nADHD-D-D\nADHD, ADHD\nADHD, it's ADHD\nADHD, it's taking over me\nADHD-D-D\n\nHaha, yeah\nHopsin, listen\nI said it once and I'll say it again man\nAyo fuck school!Embed"

Yo\nIt's kinda sad to see a fake ass Cassidy\nTrying to drastically murder me when you battle me\nHomie you're not the man you ain't even got no fans\nI beat you over the head with my mama's pots and pans\nYou shouldn't want to rhyme because the only fan you'll ever have is the one you cool off with in summer time\nYou pick me to battle, dog i'm the worst one\nI got your fuckin' mama wishing I was her son\nInstead of you i wish you would leave no residue\nI make a mess of you, You'll be needing treatment that's medical\nSo backing down from this battle is what you better do\nAh fuck it i'll show you how to wreck it dude\nYou put yourself in this situation you piece of shit you anus\nI'll rip you famous and i'll diss you back just to get YOU famous\nWhack mother fucker you can't even hit my ranges\nWhat's wrong didn't think Hopsin could come strong?\nHow you going to be a rapper, you only got one song\nI come with better art\nYour career is like a car with no battery\nHomie it ain't gonna ever start\nI'll shred apart your diss and fill your head with darts\nI'm hella smart whats happening dog? You fell apart?\nWell listen heres a big suggestion\nDon't come online when their disses present, it's a lesson\nBecause the only tight shit you've ever rapped\nWas a mother fuckin' christmas present bitch!\nYou diss my fan base? I'll sock your damn face and\nKick your knee caps in so you can't stand straight\nThis man's fake, now who's for that shit?\nCome on he has a fake New York accent\nLanguage you really thinking you at the top? (yeah)\nHow's that? soundclick voted you as a flop (ha)\nYou stupid by being the first to spit\nI ain't even gotta write another verse to this\nI murked this shit so go ahead and write a diss back\nYour shits whack, when i hear it i just laugh\nHOO-HEE-HA-HA  you're funny man\nThen I saw your picture on the internet, you're ugly man\nYou always talkin' about you're chasing whores\nWith that ugly ass face of yours? man you're faking dog\nI'LL MAKE THE CAUSE TO BREAK YOUR JAW MAKE YOU WALK HOME NAKED WHEN I TAKE YOUR DRAWERS\nNIGGA YOU CAN LICK MY GREAT BIG BALLS I'LL PUT A GUN TO YOUR HEAD MOTHER FUCKER SAY I'M RAW! SAY IT!!\nMan i'm getting tired of doing this\nYour whole career man, I just ruined it\nIt's time for me to go now (go now)\nLet your career go down (go down) OHH WOW\nWhooa I hate to break your heart\nBut Hopsin just killed Language Arts\nHeyyy fuck Language Arts\nI really really really hate to break your heart i said\nWhooa I hate to break your heart\nBut Hopsin just killed Language Arts\nHeyyy fuck Language Arts\nI really really really hate to break your heart\nNow sing Ayy yo Ayy yo Ayy yo, nigga you don't wanna step to me\nYou are just a weak MC, acting like you're from the streets\n\nFuck Language Arts!\nBitchYou might also like1Embed"

(Ah) Whose dog, ah\nWhose dog is that? *Barks*\nWhose dog is that? *Barks*\nMan, whose dog is that? *Barks*\nSomebody better put a chain on his ass, man\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm a genius up on the mic when I spit flows\nI may be a retarded nigga but I'm sick though\nStill the same small lid nigga with the big nose\nThink you can hang with the pros\nMan get yo\nYou want to go running mouth because the kid's hot\nYou should just go out and find something other than hip-hop\nI'm just trying to do what I do I'm not trying to get shot\nNiggas always hating and making me fucking flip, ahh\nI told you over and over that I don't like you\nThen niggas want to wonder why I turned into a psycho\nAll this shit has got me feeling like I'm suicidal\nYou think I'm stupid you'll be surprised at the shit that I know\nAnd I'm so wicked when I'm kickin' and spittin' shit that I'll be off of the motherfucking hizook\nHopsin is rockin' and droppin' shit all the time and if you don't believe him, go take a lizook\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nSomebody get this dog, man, he tryna fight me\nHe don't wanna see me do my thing on the mic (Thing on the mic)\n'Cause I bring the pain on the mic (Pain on the mic)\nNow whose dog? (Ah) Whose dog, ah\nWhose dog is that? *Barks*\nWhose dog is that? *Barks*\nMan, whose dog is that? *Barks*\nSomebody better put a chain on his ass, man\n\n[Verse 3]\nNigga get the dog\nNiggas have to go and make me angry\nI'm pretty sane but I may seem crazy\nAin't no way in hell I'll let these fake g's bait me\nI'm a straight monster, somebody please save me\nA lot of you rappers coming up with that fake shit\nI'm here to put an end to it nigga so face it\nI haul my black ass up cause I'm ain't going to take this\nI'm on some other type shit while y'all still on the basics\nHop's got it locked and ain't nobody stoppin' him\nAll these sick kicks that I'm bluffin' I got a lot of 'em\nFeel free to call my name if you got a problem\nOr put your fucking hands up if you wanna rock with 'em\nSomebody better take control of this dog\nBefore I cock something back and put a hole in this dog\nA hole in the stone\nLeave his ass cold on the floor\nMan this dog don't know who he fucking with yo\n[Chorus]\nSomebody get this dog, man, he tryna fight me\nHe don't wanna see me do my thing on the mic (Thing on the mic)\n'Cause I bring the pain on the mic (Pain on the mic)\nNow whose dog?

Your lazy ass don't commit to labor\nYou pick something up, try it out, and put it down two minutes later\nThen you complain about your life cause it ain't getting catered\nNow whoever tries to call you on your bullshit's a hater\nYou wanna succeed, you have to try\nOr one day you'll get older and regret it all cause you can't provide\nYour friends are lowlifes, don't act surprised\nLook, just cut the bad fruit off of the tree, make the sacrifice\n[Verse 2]\nGirls, stop acting like you want a guy with traits like Romeo\nBitch that's a fucking lie\nYou always talk about how every man's fake\nAnd you can't take it and you want something real\nShut up tramp, save it\nTwice a week you put on your makeup and damn bracelets\nAnd head to the club half-naked with your ass shaking\nPulling a lowlife nigga who claim he cash making\nTill you let him hit and find out he work at the gas station\nOne of them niggas got you pregnant and you can't raise it\nBut you caused it, your actions made a fat statement\nYou want Romeo, then act patient\nAnd stop fronting like he in the club posted in the back waitin'\nIt's the club, where guys put on a new persona\nAfter they get loaded with a few coronas\nThey always shouting and wild out with habits that very few condone of\nThen they look for beautiful brainless bitches like you to bone 'em\nThen when they leave you, you cry and cry\nTalking 'bout, \"Oh my god I can't find a guy\nI've spent so many years and I've tried and tried\nWhy am I even on Earth? I should die\"\nYou want Romeo, you're not worthy\nYou're cock-thirsty\nYou're nasty and probably got herpes\nSometimes the secret to finding is to stop searching\nTry a new formula, cause your last one's not working\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nThe term \"real nigga\"'s publicly used\nAnd I need to know what it means, cause I'm fucking confused\nAre you one for always busting your tool\nWith nothing to lose and something to prove to homies up in your crew\nIs it because you're selling drugs to get loot\nAnd brag about how you done been shot and stabbed\nLike it's fun to be you\nBut your life's a struggle, right, and you just hustling through\nNah, you hamster ass nigga, you just stuck in a loop\nMan, why do black people gotta be the only ones who can't evolve\nCause you in the streets acting like a neanderthal\nIt's clear you can't stand the law, you're lost as an abandoned dog\nAnd all you're interested in is fighting, rapping, and basketball\nI can't even fuck with you, cause if we out in public\nYou gon' get caught stealing some shit and get my ass in trouble, too\nYou'll get old and be nothing\nLiving life in these streets, thugging and starting shit with anybody mean mugging\nLook at you, a real nigga, thinking your life's cool\nGirls used to turn me down for guys who were like you\nTill you grab their heart and shove a spearhead right through\nThen they regret it because it wasn't the right move\nYour real nigga talk seems bogus\nA real nigga don't brag about being real as long as he knows it\nAnd his future doesn't seem hopeless\nA real nigga stays out of jail, handles shit, and he keeps focused\n[Verse 4]\nTo all you rappers whose soul is out in the wrong\nYou inspired the issue I wrote about in this song\nYou go to prowl on the young who roam around in the slums\nSee this is what happens when rap's overcrowded with bums\nHope the hour's long when I'm rolling out with your tongue\nThe man above is my guide, you know the power is strong\nAll you menacing freaks are only in it for cheese\nAnd the mass control limit was breached - fuck hip-hop\nThey only in it for cheese, and any eyewitness can see\nThey purposely making the innocent weak\nMy existence on this planet's for you, I ain't only here to benefit me\nYo, we need to make a change while there's still time\nIt is hard, and sometimes I struggle trying to reveal mine\nI can guide you if you feel blind\nI just need you to be willing to journey into my ill mindEmbed"

(I LOVE YOU!) I keep a handful of ugly groupies I deny, knowing if they ever showed up at my crib by surprise. (What the fuck?)\n[Verse 2: Jaylenz]\nNiggas gonna recognize, we the coldest niggas [?] shit\n[Adlib:Hopsin](Huh?)\nI been off for a minute, now I'm back in this bitch. I'm going off [?], bitch I been ripping this\n[Adlib:Hopsin](What?)\nAny minute and I'm with it, come and get it cause I been killing it\n[Adlib:Hopsin](Uh-huh)\n[Adlib:Hopsin](Get it)\n[Adlib:Hopsin](Oh)\n\n[x3](It is what it is)\n\n(I been up on this, I'm a motherfucking selfish cat. Quick to walk on niggas like a welcome mat. Wassup?)\n\n[x2](It is what it is)\n\n(So bitch suck a dick, the kids busting sick. I'm a motherfucking selfish cat, quick to walk on niggas like a welcome mat. Wassup?)\n\n[Verse 3: Jaylenz]\nYo, it is what it is, [?] for the kids\nBreak into your crib and stick a fucking pen through your rib\nI'll get you pinned to the fridge as I empty this clip into the cat and dog, and get to fucking busting like I'm jacking off\nI laugh it off when it comes to the thought of death and shit\nGot the angel and devil on my shoulder steady wrestlin'\nCheck inside your mom, you'll most likely find my specimen\nMy jizz will paint her face whiter than the forty second president\nQuietly evident, popping medicine just to get me off\n[?] and bungee jump with some dental floss\nHit from the back so hard, you see my penis is her jaws\nGo deeper and give birth to myself while she in menopause\nIt's probably my potty mouth that got you mad, cause I'm a motherfucking grouch hopping in trash, and smoke [?]'s ass\nMy dick's harder than jerking off with a doctor's cost, shot his ass, then hide in the same spot that 2Pac is at\nYou might also like[x4](It is what it is)\n(I been up on this, I'm a motherfucking selfish cat. Quick to walk on niggas like a welcome mat. Wassup?)\n\n[x2](It is what it is)\n(So bitch suck a dick, I been up on this. The kid's busting sick. I'm a motherfucking selfish cat. Quick to walk on niggas like a welcome mat. Wassup?)\n\n[x8](Suck a dick)\n\n(Hopsin)Embed"

Please pay for me\"\nI make that pussy pop for you like you skateboarding\nThen you can come inside like a hurricane warning\nI got a lot of sluts, I like to call Hopsin luck\nBut now I feel like having sex with these bitches is not enough\nI needed something new for moments when I gotta bust\nSo lately I've been beating my dick with a pair of boxing gloves\nI got the maddest rhymes, how dare yo ass deny?\nI'll stab you in the brain with a knife, you can keep that in mind\nYou talking shit inside your house? Cool, fine, fuck it\nI'll break in and stomp you out inside of it\nYeah, HopsinYou might also like1Embed"

Answer that 'cause he don't know\nAnd he's so broke that he can't even eat no mo'\nBehind on all of his bills because his cheese don't grow\nMy life is usually harsh, I got a bruise on my heart\nThat's why my music is dark, I gotta do it, it's part\nOf this reason that I was put on this planet we call Earth\nHopefully in the end, I see what it was all worth\nCome on\n[Chorus]\nDo you recall when I was down?\nScreamin' out, but you were not around\nBitch, I'll see you in hell\nI can't believe you left me hanging\nYou make me angryYou might also likeEmbed"

Lyrics[Intro]\nDrop that\nWhat y'all knew about Hopsin?\nWhat y'all knew about Hopsin?\n\n[Verse 1]\nCheck it\nI flow them words that hits you like smokin' herbs\nConvince you to throw them birds since you so disturbed\nI won't even bother with dissin' you on a verse\n[?] went in worse, my niggas be on alert\nI'll have you on your knees sittin' alone in church\nWhen I interrupt on the turf my nigga it's gonna hurt\nI guarantee that blood'll be leakin' up on your shirt\nI sock you into a casket and send you into the earth\nOh snap looks like he ain't what he thought he'd be\nThought he could slaughter me rawly, the orders where we all be\nVicious is just a part of me, leave the hitman then call on me\nAnd follow me as I'm causin' this rage be involved wit' me\nIt's all a mystery how I make flawless victories\nFrom splittin' wigs and leavin' a shiny and bald like Mr. Clean\nMy style is fresher than niggas who swallow Listerine\nI'll have you begging for life, the rest is all in history\n[Hook]\nMan! What y'all niggas know about Hopsin?\nNothing! we just know he always drop hot shit\nC'mon fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up, bust 'em up, bust 'em up\nCut 'em up, cut 'em up, shut 'em up, shut 'em up\nMan! What y'all know about Hopsin?\nNothing! they just know I always drop hot shit\nHopsin gon' make it hot, wack niggas shake the spot\nWhy the fuck y'all niggas stalling, time to get this party started\n\n[Verse 2]\nFor nigga think he tired I just feel like I gotta diss him\nPut him on blast nigga 'cause Hopsin know to whip him\nMake that nigga cry ocean 'til his momma get him\nAnd if you wanna take it to the streets you know I'm boxing with him\nWhen it to comes to fighting Hopsin got a lot of victims\nSince elementary school I was anxious to sock and kick 'em\nHang around me long enough and you can even witness the field\nBut once you hear the (whoopsie) I'm gonna (finish him)\nIt ain't Mortal Kombat it's combat of mortals\nYou get whoopty woos by me not Jax or Goro\nI smack the cornrow right off the top of your dome\nInstead of popping the chrome leave you dazed off in the zone\nHopsin is sick with the provocative flow\nI'm as solid as bones and if you sit talk in my throne\nI wouldn't bother to answer with that knock of the door\nYou wind up missing in the woods and nobody you'll know\nYou might also like[Hook]\nMan! What y'all niggas know about Hopsin?\nNothing! we just know he always drop hot shit\nC'mon fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up, bust 'em up, bust 'em up\nCut 'em up, cut 'em up, shut 'em up, shut 'em up\nMan! What y'all know about Hopsin?\nNothing! they just know I always drop hot shit\nHopsin gon' make it hot, wack niggas shake the spot\nWhy the fuck y'all niggas stalling, time to get this party started\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm dangerous, gaffled this shit and my name [?]\nMy venom is angry, my adrenaline ain't weak\nIf a nigga fuck around I'ma get him the same week\nWhy you act raw when you niggas is mainly\nLike a fresh pack of lemurs 'cause your limit'll spray sleeps\nWack life act like you living the crazy\nLet me tell you something you criminals ain't g's\n'Cause when Hopsin come around your women is ain't shizzin'\nQuick to dump you know chicks'll run\n[?]\nYour old Hopsin a monster\nQuick as thunder, whip you under two seconds flat\nNiggas like whose flesh is that\nDon't test this cat you're best as [?]\nYour gats are weak you be falling fast asleep\nI'ma deck you so hard, I'ma crack your teeth\nAnd let my homies have a piece to smash the beat\n[Hook]\nMan! What y'all niggas know about Hopsin?\nNothing! we just know he always drop hot shit\nC'mon fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up, bust 'em up, bust 'em up\nCut 'em up, cut 'em up, shut 'em up, shut 'em up\nMan! What y'all know about Hopsin?\nNothing! they just know I always drop hot shit\nHopsin gon' make it hot, wack niggas shake the spot\nWhy the fuck y'all niggas stalling, time to get this party started\n\n[Hook]\nMan!

You'll get fucked up\nRun up, bum rush, um-hut, fuck you\nStuff you with my four, then chuck you\nIn the middle of a ditch, it's your little lover (Shit)\nGo and get another dick, here's a riddle for you bitch\nWhat's raw, half all in, ballin'? That you can't have at all? (It's me)\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI know I'm everything you could want (You could want), oh\nBut you ain't got what I'm looking for, (Looking for), oh\nSo go and find another nigga and stop wasting your time\nYou must be outta your mind, girl\n\n[Interlude]\nBaby, I know I've been messed up in the past\nBut that's just who I am, and I ain't never gon' change\nI'm sorry, baby\n\n[Verse 3]\nCouldn't wait to play your ass like Halo 2\nThought I'd buy you things, I won't get a thing for you\nBreath always kickin' like you just ate tofu\nGo get your little friends, what they gon' do?\nShame on you, you ain't able to\nTurn the fellas on, that's why they ain't on you\nSo before you think about try to land by my way, listen to \"The Workout Plan\" by Kanye\nIf you do or don't, I don't really fuckin' care\nI can't explain how I feel, 'cause there's nothing there\nListen girl, there's something I wanna share\nI never took you out 'cause people was gonna stare\nAnd I ain't tryna ruin my reputation\nI ain't even want to be in that situation\nAnd it ain't enough that I'm a special education\nWe never spent time, so there was no time wasted\n[Chorus]\nI know I'm everything you could want (You could want), oh\nBut you ain't got what I'm looking for, (Looking for), oh\nSo go and find another nigga and stop wasting your time\nYou must be outta your mind, girl\nI know I'm everything you could want, oh\nBut you ain't got what I'm looking for, oh\nSo go and find another nigga and stop wasting your time\nYou must be outta your mind, girl\nI know I'm everything you could want, oh\nBut you ain't got what I'm looking for, oh\nSo go and find another nigga and stop wasting your time\nYou must be outta your mind\n\n[Outro]\nI wanna know, are you gonna call her, and text her and apologize to her?\nYou fuckin' 'round and talkin' 'bout her, you are such a dumb prick\nYou I wanted you to know that now\nOh, you're a fuckin' assholeEmbed"

Girl\nThese stab wounds multiply in your world\nYeah, they all plural\nI don't kill for the thrill, its for the nerds with the mills\nStill but no ladies to chill, its ill\nI don't find enjoyment, I find employment\nSlice a prostitute in the loins quick\nMoist grips, firmness, drooling from my lips\nSee the ripper can't be ripped, on his own shit\nSelf [??] yeah i ride my own dick\n\n[Chorus]\nSo in my mind we're fucking\nIn my mind we grinding\nIn my mind still unwinding\nI had to rip her, rip her, sick like the ripper, the ripper\nIn my mind we grinding, grinding\nStill unwinding, I had to rip her, rip her\nSick like the ripper, the ripperEmbed"

Trust me I'm right\nGo to the motherfucking gym and lose the gut and you're fine\nYou might also like[Hook]\nMama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen\nMama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen\nI be banging on the pans in the kitchen\nSo mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen\nMama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen\nMama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen\nI be banging on the pans in the kitchen\nSo mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen\n\nI like playing with the pans in the kitchen mama\nYou gon' let me play with the pans in the kitchen mama\nDon't care what you say about the pans in the kitchen mama\nI'ma prove that I'm the man in the kitchen mama!\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm Marcus and yes I am stupid\nThought I was a smart nigga? Guess again, stupid\nI'm a special ed student\nGive me a couple of bars and let the man prove it\n'Cause there's evidence to it\nI never knew it, but the rest of the class knew it\nThey must've thought I'd never remember the past to it\nForget school, man, I never could pass through it\nI never be that student that headed to class who gets an A\nUp on his report card, a nice kid who's so smart\nSeem like when they threw me in special ed It got more hard\nEvery year the cycle repeats over again\nMy friends graduate and I'm way older then them\nThen they come to me, nice mugging me, making fun of me\nWhat do these ugly motherfuckers be thinking when they fuck with me?\nThey lucky I don't suddenly go and become something other than me\nLike a fucking psycho, then what's it gonna be?\n[Hook]\nMama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen\nMama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen\nI be banging on the pans in the kitchen\nSo mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen\nMama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen\nMama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen\nI be banging on the pans in the kitchen\nSo mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen\n\nI like playing with the pans in the kitchen mama\nYou gon' let me play with the pans in the kitchen mama\nDon't care what you say about the pans in the kitchen mama\nI'ma prove that I'm the man in the kitchen mama!\n(Man in the kitchen mama....)Embed"

   "lyrics": "Bus Pass Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYo, my family never had cheese, the pain ate us\nMy mom would always say not to hang with the gang bangers\nSo most of my life I would chill with the same skaters\nBustin' up curbs 'til cops would vacate us\nAnd every other day, I wore the same old shirt\nHad a lot of roaches, but the Raid won't work\nThe girls I'd try to holler at, they don't flirt\n'Cause in Hollywood, they wanna see your payroll first, check it\nBut I don't even got a dime for these niggas\nI done made residuals off of the rhymes I done spit\nLot of little niggas clowning 'cause time I done spent\nTryna buzz, your life's great, but mine is a bitch\nYo, it's times like this that I regret dropping out\nBut on the mic, I got a bite like a crocodile\nLet me see your tig bitties, girl, pop 'em out\nHopsin, I'm the nigga niggas talkin' 'bout\n[Chorus]\nI can't even grow in a mustache\nAnd plus I'm pickin' girls up with a bus pass\nWhat's my name? (Hop, hop, hop, hop)\nUh-huh (Hop, hop), uh-huh (Hop, hop)\nWhat's my name? (Hop, hop, hop, hop)\nUh-huh (Hop, hop), uh-huh (Hop, hop)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, yo, isolated 'cause I use to get beat up\nLooked down on 'cause I never achieved much\nI'm not the type to get put on the spot and then freeze up\nNever been a fan of Soulja Boy because he sucks\nWhoops, I didn't mean to get your nerves all jumpin'\nWe could bang to the Navy, say we heard y'all bumpin'\nAnd for all my drunk niggas, keep the Smirnoff coming\n'Til you try to jump in your whip and then swerve off something, uh\nNow let me tell you why the world don't like me\n'Cause I'm a motherfuckin' jerk, no tight jeans\nAnd you can tell it from my eyes when the light beam\nMy hot flow is so cold like ice cream\nI'm hittin' niggas with the oxymorons\nMy ex girlfriend'll tell you Hop's a moron\nBut don't be a fool, you should lock your doors, son\n'Cause there's a lot of rappers I'ma drop the torch on\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI can't even grow in a mustache\nAnd plus I'm pickin' girls up with a bus pass\nWhat's my name? (Hop, hop, hop, hop)\nUh-huh (Hop, hop), uh-huh (Hop, hop)\nWhat's my name? (Hop, hop, hop, hop)\nUh-huh (Hop, hop), uh-huh (Hop, hop)\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou wanna battle, little niggas? I'll serve you\n'Cause I be going in like I got a curfew\nMost of you niggas gettin' paid don't deserve to\nNow bang your motherfuckin' head 'til it hurts you\nThe new dude, check my video on YouTube\n'Cause at the moment, I'll be lucky to get two views\nFuck ballin', I'm too lazy to shoot hoops\nI should shoot you with the deuce-deuce\nMaybe that'll make my pocks grow larger\nCan't sell like I lost my charger\nGirls yellin' out, \"Hop, go harder\"\nMaybe I can cut, but I'm not no barber (Nah)\nWest Coast, throw it up like a hangover\nKool-Aid in my cup 'cause I stay sober (Yeah)\nI got ADHD, I'm a straight goner (Yeah)\nYou don't feel me? Nigga, make the bass lower\n[Chorus]\nI can't even grow in a mustache\nAnd plus I'm pickin' girls up with a bus pass\nWhat's my name? (Hop, hop, hop, hop)\nUh-huh (Hop, hop), uh-huh (Hop, hop)\nWhat's my name? (Hop, hop, hop, hop)\nUh-huh (Hop, hop), uh-huh (Hop, hop)Embed"

You gots to like\nThe way that I spit, making these hits\nYou play for the quits, it's making you get all shaky and shit\nYou wanna get on the floor now, zone out, no doubt\nGo now, won't I go wild, go out\nBaby, baby (Baby, baby)\nI don't know about the AD, but you sure do who got the HD\nAdrenaline pumps, I'm gettin' em in drunk while spitting the funk\nThe real things living amongst us\n'Cause I'm sure you feel the bass hitting your trunk\nThis the song that y'all niggas gon' be singing for months\nWell I hope it is, so a nigga don't go homeless\nGo with it, Hopsin's a ill rap vocalist\nMost of this shit I do is just for the kids\nStruggling in school and running into situations\nThat could to lead to bustin' M2s\nI understand 'cause I was once a rugged kid too\nYou ain't even knowing all the stuff I been through\nYou think you had it hard, I had it rougher than you\nBut I'm grown up now, doing most stuff now\nBall in my hands and I'm going for the touchdown\nWhat now? I'ma live a rich life somehow\nKeep the rap game locked 'til I get somethin' out\n[Chorus: Group of Kids]\nNow if you heard rap from the rest\nThen you will know that he's the best\nAnd if you could go down his way\nYou will find out he don't play\nIf you met that nigga, though\nYou will think that he is slow\nThat's just because you don't know\nHopsin, show them how you flow\n\n[Verse 2: Hopsin]\nMost y'all rappers is weak, you should hate your life\nYou played out like them turbo Hondas Asian's drive\nSo next time don't even bother when you write pens\nAnd don't think you tight 'cause your momma she says she likes it\nY'all niggas is wack, why you tryna get on my shit?\n'Cause you know that I'm hotter than your white bitch\nI put it down, I ain't gotta get a psychic\nI hate my own, man I gotta get a sidekick\nBut listen, yo, I'm a invincible, kickin' flow\nShit is all critical, Hopsin, you already know\nSo no need to explain myself\nI'm just a ghetto nigga tryna gain my wealth\nSo while I'm kinda hot now\nI'ma prove that I'm something more than a dropout\nEven if a nigga gotta be really hostile\nEverybody watch out, the door's almost closed I ain't tryna get locked out\nGotta hurry up and make a way quickly\nAnd once I get in, can't let the game get me\nI know I'm fucked up, but nigga, I ain't fifteen\nThis shit gon' fade away the next day and stay with me\nBaby, that's the reason people never hang with me\nWhen you in my shoes, that's the way shit be\nI'm a straight MC, listen to the shit in my songs\nFuck y'all, I'll do this shit on my own\nYou might also like[Chorus: group of kids]\nNow if you heard rap from the rest\nThen you will know that he's the best\nAnd if you could go down his way\nYou will find out he don't play\nIf you met that nigga, though\nYou will think that he is slow\nThat's just because you don't know\nCome on Hopsin, time to go\n\n[Outro]\nMan, shut the fuck up, stupid kids\nKilled my song, manEmbed"

It ain't much to do to get here\nJust stay in high school for six years\nAnd never take your ADD medicine, ayy\nAnd drop out when your just a couple of credits away\nFrom graduation, you can't take what they had you facing\nIt's stressful, that's why I relieve it with masturbation\nPretend like I'm waiting for marriage like my ass was patient\nBut really I wanna rape woman with the mask of Jason\nMy nose is big and ears are small like I was animation\nI walk around zoned out like my ass was wasted\nWhen no one's home, I take a bath and leave the bathroom naked\nI hear somebody coming, then I bust evacuation\nMy teacher don't like me 'cause I'm always talkin negative shit\nWhat can I say? I'm not a regular kid\nBut I don't care what the bitch say\nAin't picked up knowledge since the 6th grade\nWhy my life gotta be this way?\nI'm too much of a bitch to smoke, I don't sniff the coke\nWhy people think this kid's a joke, huh?\nI'm talented and you remember that\n'Cause on the microphone I got more skills than you'll ever have\nMy ten year old friends think they smarter in life\nThan me 'cause they school work is harder than mine\nI don't really feel school shit, so don't be comin' 'round me\nFeelin' all smart, it's just somethin' real stupid\nWhat?\n[Outro]\nWoah, woah, woah, woah, I step out for five minutes and this is what you guys do?\nMarcus, get your ADD ass up and go to the dean (Aw, man, nah)\nEverybody open up your books to chapter 14, I'm sick of this shit\nYou're starting to get on my last nerve, Mr. HopsinYou might also likeEmbed"

Then you already fucked up\nEveryone is nuts, what? Slip and get your guts cut\nMost of us are pissed 'cause there's no access to a slut's butt\nI'm always thinking, \"Why am I here?\" Then get mad\nMy family lied and said we were going to Six Flags\nI left all their necks with a big gash\nTook the wheel and zig-zagged and spun the fuck out of control and then crashed\nFlew out the windshield and hit my head on the block\nCranium gashed open, you could've read all my thoughts\nThe doctor had told me that I should've been dead on the spot\nNow I'm crazy as my daddy who meddles with pot\nFuck the nurses here, I take my shank and I hold it beside 'em\nCut 'em up and shared the meal with Psycho Sick Asylum\nAnd we repeat the cycle weekly\nYou wanna relax? Then follow me, I'll take you to an esctasy where life is easy\n[Chorus]\nThis place ain't what it appears to be (I thought you should know)\nSo tell me what you came to see (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)\nWelcome to the asylum (Hello, hello)\nIf you want some trouble, you can find some (Yeah, dawg)You might also likeEmbed"

About how you can do so much better. I want to play a game, Marcus, I want you to save as I save. Are you the savior you claim to be, Marcus? Here's how it works; I have surgically placed a pair of headphones to your skull with a timer set to self-destruct in 75 minutes. For your salvation, Marcus, I have placed a recording device in front of you. You must capture the raw truth of your life, Marcus. Give your voice or die.
