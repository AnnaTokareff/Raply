Cordae,How a “Hi Level” Mindset Helps You Realize Your Potential,2022,"How a “Hi Level” Mindset Helps You Realize Your Potential LyricsHows everybody doing today?||So for those of you who may not know who i am|Which is probably the vast majority of you all|My name is Cordae|I'm 24 years old|I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina but was raised majority in|Suitland, Maryland which made me who i am today||I'm Hip-Hop artist more specifically a Grammy-nominated Hip-hop artist|A quote unquote critically acclaimed world-renowned B-list celebrity but to be honest more like B minus|but again you all can just call me Cordae|And assume that i'm almost kind of a big deal|Because i'm here doing a TED Talk|Now i know what you're thinking what does a 24 year old rapper possibly have to say during a TED Talk|Like who cares what ja rule thinks you know|But i'm here to talk about my mantra and my way of life that has gotten me this far and can hopefully take me a lot further on my journey as I'm just getting started and that's the ""Hi level mindset""|Now before i get into the details about the Hi level mindset|I want to tell you about the original creator of the Hi level mindset|That's my mom she doesn't even know it|My mother had me when she was 16 years old|She was single mom with all the odds against her|And yet from an unbiased perspective|I like to say she did a pretty decent job|We live in some pretty terrible neighborhoods man|I switched elementary schools about five different times|I remember one time her car had got stolen twice in one week|She overcame circumstance obstacles her environment and negativity as i watched our living situations would continue toget|Better and better as the years went by now that's hi level|Now the high level mindset wasn't something  that she directly|Taught me or purposefully instilled in me but something i learned|Simply by observation the hi level mindset is a philosophy|It's a wavelength to apply to your everyday thought's and regiment the hi level mindset will be of great service to you|Especially when things aren't going as planned|These trying times that i speak of or life testers if you may|Are what truly make us man and woman|Actually scratch that how we handle these lifetimes|These trying times or life testers is what decides a person's destiny which bring me step one of the Hi mindset|And that's always remain positive no matter what people or life may throw at you|Now im going to give a little bit of background myself|Funny enough i was actually voted most likely to be famous|In both middle school and high school|Now i know what you're thinking im sorry|i haven't always been this good looking it takes a little bit of time|My goal was gratuade highschool and to immediately blow up|But that didn't happen so i went to college and as soon as i went to college boy did life hit me hard within the first couple of weeks of school one of my best friends that i called my brother had gotten sentenced to 24 years in prison|I had gotten detained for driving with suspended license|Amongst other things like having a pound of weed in the car before it was legal and my grandmother had passed|Not to mention i was already a terrible student with horrific grades and a broke teenager and i wonder why my grades were so bad now that's just disrespectful i wasn't even trying to hide it|But on top of all these things what was really the breaking point for me was that i had released a mixtape that i worked on the entire summer and it only had gotten 200 downloads|Now my previous two mixtapes got 2,000 downloads|So i was not happy with the regression to say the least|Again this almost pushed me to the brink of quitting and insanity|But the Hi level mindset made me think man|These misfortunes are just going to make my triumph story a lot cooler i used this as fuel to the fire motivation if you will|It made me think you know life is just book|Not every chapter is going to be perfect|But it's about how it ends|Which bring me to the second step of the Hi level mindset|Always be intentional with your desires|Know exactly what you want in 2018 i created a vision board|At the beginning of 2018 excuse i created a vision board|And im proud to say that with the Hi mindset|Within one year i almost accomplished everything on here|Y'all can clap for that|So i encourage you to just write down your goals|Starting off your day with reading your goals and dreams aloud|Gives you a boost of positive energy|This energy can be transmuted into something we call faith|Faith in your ability faith in yourself faith in a higher power|Will take you to places you can't even imagine|Know exactly what you want|How can you be Hi level if you don't know what Hi level is to you?|And in order to do all these things it brings me to third step of the hi level mindset discipline growing up discipline was always taught in such a lame way that i always tried my best to avoid it|But where motivation is low that's where discipline kicks in|Anybody who done something noteworthy with their lives|All have one thing in common and that's discipline|Mastering the art of discipline will literally change your life|I witnessed this close hand by studying a friend up close|This friend of mine noticed that every time he stopped doing drugs and alcohol something would happen he felt as though|This was a divine calling from heaven above to halt all his vices|Now can anyone tell me the three main vices of a 19 year old college student? It's sex alcohol and drugs|If you all didn't know that already|And after the first six months of him stopping his vices|I seen his whole life change completely|Again he thought this is a sign that maybe God doesn't want me to do drugs drink alcohol or have sex|But no that's not the case thank you|He was just simply learning discipline without knowing|Alright i have confession to make because i don't want to make this entire TED Talk about myself|I lied and said that this is a friend it was actually me|Now a cheat code to ensure that you're staying disciplined to|Whatever you're striving for is to prime your environment for success your habits are based on your habitat and the main product of your habitat are the people in your life|Which brings me to a very important step of the Hi level mindset|The fourth step to exact|Remove all negative people out of your life immediately|Anybody that's semidoubtful or naysaying get them out|If you're talking about your dreams and goals and they give small|Sarcastic remarks boot them just an all around negative Nancy?|Kick them out of there man|Does anybody in the audience know somebody that's like that?|Please raise your hand|I need you all to do me favor|Pull your phone's out and block them immediately|No no no im dead serious|Don't let someone else's negativity cancel out your light|For it can temporarily get in the way of you achieving what's owe to you|You are a product of those who you hang around you|Let's make sure we're hanging around positive Hi level individuals|Now thank you|Now i like to consider myself a master at this Hi level stuff|I mean i am here for reason right?Embed"
