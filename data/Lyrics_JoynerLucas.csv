Maybe it's my fault|I shoulda paid more attention to what you been doin'|Maybe I should have been more of an influence|I can't believe that you're dead, I fu–|I read your letter and all I could do is have mixed feelings about it|But I'll forever be attached to you (Damn)|Part of me feels bad for you|A part of me feels like you weak and I'm mad at you|And I don't mean to be insensitive|But I don't understand how we couldn't prevent this shit|You took the easy way out, goddammit, you did|I mean, look what you did, I'm so fucking upset|How could you be so selfish?|Nigga, how could you be so selfish?|Now you're gone, you done left me so helpless|I wonder what God thinks, I hope you in God's place behaving yourself|Yo, what the fuck you gotta say for yourself?

Joyner Lucas,I’m Not Racist,2017,"I’m Not Racist Lyrics[Verse 1]|With all due respect|I don't have pity for you black niggas, that's the way I feel|Screamin', ""Black Lives Matter""|All the black guys'd rather be deadbeats than pay your bills|Yellin', ""Nigga,"" this, and, ""Nigga,"" that|Call everybody, ""Nigga,"" and get a nigga mad|As soon as I say, ""Nigga,"" then everyone react|And wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black|Well pound that, then|Talkin' 'bout slavery like you was around back then|Like you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then|Like you was on the plantation gettin' down back then|Aight, look|I see a black man aimin' his gun|But I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son|And I don't mean just for one day and you done, I mean|You still trapped in a rut|And I work my ass off and pay my taxes for what?|So you can keep livin' on free government assistance?|Food stamps for your children, but you still tryna sell 'em|For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter?|While you party on the road 'cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?|You already late|You motherfuckers need to get your damn priorities straight, wait|It's like you're proud to be fake|But you lazy as fuck|And you'd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight|And then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face|You can't escape problems|You can pray for some change, but can't break a dollar|Got nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald|""They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom""|My voice been back|I'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black|I'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy got a brother and his girlfriend's black|My head's in the cloud|Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house|Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out|Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now|I'm not racist, and I never lie|But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine|I worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs|But you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my God|And all you care about is rappin' and stuntin' and bein ratchet, and that's the nigga within you|Music rottin' your brain and slowly start to convince you|Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues|Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks|Blame it on everybody except for your own race|Blame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids|And just blame it on white citizens, aim at the vice president|Bunch of class clowns|Niggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down|How dare you try to make demands for this money?|You gon' show us some respect, you gon' stand for this country, nigger|I'm not racist, I'm just prepared for this type of war|I heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?|Y'all can take that motherfucker too, he ain't white no more|It's like you wanna be so famous|You'll do anything for attention and a little payment|I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers|Pants hangin' off your ass, you ain't got no home trainin'?|Pull your fuckin' pants up, nigga|Put that suit back on, take that durag off|Take that gold out your mouth, quit the pitiful stuff|And then maybe police'd stop killin' you fucks, yo, what the fuck?|I'm not racist|It's like we're livin' in the same building, but split into two floors|I'm not racist|But there's two sides to every story, I wish that I knew yours|I wish that I knew yours|I'm not racist, I swear|[Verse 2]|With all disrespect|I don't really like you white motherfuckers, that's just where I'm at|Screaming, ""All Lives Matter,"" is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?|And that's one war you'll never win|The power in the word, ""Nigga,"" is a different sin|We shouldn't say it, but we do, and that's just what it is|But that don't mean that you can say it just 'cause you got nigga friends|Nigga|That word was originated for you to keep us under|And when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other|And when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under|And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically|That don't mean I'm not affected by the history|My grandmama was a slave, that shit gets to me|And you ain't got no motherfuckin' sympathy, you pussy nigga|I'm sorry, you can never feel my life|Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright|It's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites|Judging me by my skin color and my blackness|Tryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet|Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet|You crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics|Don't talk about no motherfuckin' taxes|When I ain't making no dough|You think you know everything, but you don't|You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know|Try to steal black culture and then make it your own, woah|Fuck, I'm exhausted|I can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit|I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit|All you do is false shit, this the shit that I'm forced with|And you don't know shit about my people, that's what bothers you|You don't know about no fried chicken or no barbecue|You don't know about the two-step or no loose change|You don't know about no 2 Chainz or no Kool-Aid, you don't know|And even though Barack was half as black|You hated President Obama, I know that's a fact|You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back|And then you gave us Donald Trump and now it's payback for that|I'm not racist, I never lied|But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mines|Yeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god|He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died, nigga, die, nigga|And all you care about is money and power and being ugly and that's the cracker within you|Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you|And then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue|Blame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ|Blame it on everybody except for your own race|Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens|Aim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent, but|I might be any day now|Treatin' everybody how you want and any way how|I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now|And now I'm duckin' every time I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit|You know I make a lot of sense, but you just can't admit it|When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest|'Cause even though he's white, he let us know he standin' with us|I'm not racist, but I cry a lot|You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot|You don't know what it's like to mind your business|And get stopped by the cops and not know if you 'bout to die or not|You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine|I love you, but I fuckin' hate you at the same time|I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives|So we could understand each other more, but that'd take time|I'm not racist|It's like we livin' in the same building, but split into both sides|I'm not racist|But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine|You might also like[Outro]|Can't erase the scars with a bandage|I'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'|Agree to disagree, we could have an understandin'|I'm not racist170Embed"
