And naturally we all black and white are schadenfreude or malicious. Here are a few examples||Emmett Till, August 28th, 1955, Mississippi — pulled out of his house in the middle of the night, in front of his mother who had to watch her son be taken from her on the sidelines, for little to no reason at all worth murdering a fourteen-year-old boy.  Castrated, mutilated, but also documented for the years to see|Kori Ali Muhammad, black-on-white. Philando Castile, white-on-black.  Now these things never come to or remotely remain in the public eye. And the youth is never inspired to take a stand to make a difference. So I will speak for them. The youth, that is, the ones full of innocence. The ones inspired by the things around them, to matter||I can go on forever about the fact that murder is murder whether you're black or white. You should always feel free to voice your opinion, but to act out on these irrational thoughts in every shape or form is disgusting. You cannot, as black or white, call yourself the supreme race when moved out of your comfort by the opposition's color, their skin color.  That is no form of being or demonstrating being a supreme being||If you are a supremacist, be unmoved by the opposition. Remain unscathed in the comfort of your own home, in your own realm. Demonstrate care for the youth's future, white or black, black or white. Are you willing to risk your child's future due to your own bigotry?

So, I'll offer this warning and set of instructions; if you are not open-minded before you listen to this album, open your mind. If you don't listen to the alternative sound and you've never been into the alternative sound and have not been open to trying different things; open your mind before you listen to this album. You can listen to it anywhere, preferably your room, your car, but it can be played anywhere. This album is far different, far more versatile, far more uplifting than the last. It's something you can find comfort in, it's very comforting, but discomforting at the same time. So, with this project, again, you're entering my mind, feeling my insanity, feeling my, my genius, my energy. EnjoyYou might also like27Embed"

The more you apply your attention towards your success.|The more you apply your attention to the good things around you, the more you apply your attention to the things that you want in your life is the more it appears.|And that, there's no other way to actually say that, so for those of you that feel like you've been thrown into some sort of disarray.|[glitch]|Woah, did it pause?
