I'm only 'bout six hours from Philly|That's an hour on the plane, I'll make it three in the Bentley|My bitch keep sayin' I'm famous, but it ain't hit me|I'm too ghetto, mellowed out, this Hollywood shit tricky|See, before I knew an A&R, I was weighin' hard|Back when Nicki Minaj was in a trainin' bra|You play this game, you better play it hard|The judge'll give you life and later that day, he gon' be playin' golf|I'm from that era, we don't pay it if you weighed it wrong|Back when your parents got your baby shoes plated bronze|We took hip-hop and made it ours|I sold quarters, just so happens I'm the author of your favorite songs|They bullshitted me, I played along|More bars than them niggas who got hit with the Reagan laws|Let's go|[Verse 2: Black Thought]|Yo, when we was hooked in the hood, gettin' booked like literature|Kept us shook, like when the boogieman comin' to get ya|We was crooks, tryna cop more rides than Great Adventure|Any image we took, not a father was in the picture|There was times, not a bite nor swallow was in the kitchen|Real niggas made a industry out of they intuition|Facin' the darkest outcome, sprintin' to outrun the reaper|Trying not to be the food in the mouth of the beast|For whom the bell tolls|Crown kings in Adidas suits and shell toes|We had to throw a lot of body blows and elbows|Wishin' we could get from Snyder Ave to Melrose|Without the Dapper Dan bodybags and jail clothes|That warned niggas not to lollygag when Hell rose|We railroaded through the thicker things for gold chains and chicken change|No one throwin' flames, there's growin' pains when in the game|And the blow, ashes in the snow, it's no remains|Push the wheel as fast as it could go, we overcame the obstacles|But when you official, the block miss you|Even if the old crew choose not to rock with you|We was blue-black, stuck in the glue trap|I had to pull my own self up by the bootstrap|Where everybody play they own part like a tooth gap|And old heads teach the young hitters to shoot back|I been livin' proof that the pressure make precious stones|And real Clarence Avants remain lesser known|But anybody who question you, send a message to 'em|I see my seat at the table to be a blessed throne|Triumph and tragedy, his majesty muscle never atrophied|The devil is a casualty, sucker, you're never catchin' me|Even though you been after me, motherfucker|You gotta bring a army to harm me, I occupy the capacity up|Decapitator of a hater in this modern day|My dossier no less, dealer spray Courvoisier|I'm Jean-Paul Gaultier, Tom Ford, and Cartier|Self-made, I fly vintage from the sommelier|On reserve, flowin' from the blackest fountain|It's all love from public housin' to the Atlas Mountains|I've established the average to always bat a thousand|So after butcherin' this track, it's back to countin'|The money generated from me leavin' microphones broke|Probably almost on par with all of Escobar's coke|When I'm finished, I'ma keep a tennis shoe on y'all throat|Just in case you mention in a interview you want smoke, nigga|Two FifteenYou might also like13Embed"

Benny the Butcher,Fire in the Crib,2021,"Fire in the Crib LyricsEver hit a nigga with some work and he dead you?|That ain't the same energy he had when he begged you|My crackhead uncle used to steal from his nephew|Now when he ask for cash I just say God bless you|Six figures a year offa pipes and addicts|But I could double that now with one flight to Dallas|Rolled with a scale and weighed it out, right in traffic|I used to cop bad work because the price was average|Somebody get clipped, they think I paid for the bounty|Ask these record execs if I was paid 'fore they found me|Really getting the cake, Michigan plates on a Audi|To a nigga getting stocky eating trays in a county|Niggas spend they money on jewellery, ain't knockin' 'em|They scary though, if it ain't a video, they ain't rockin' 'em|Private chef, New York strip, steak and tilapia|Private jet, did shit niggas ain't think was possible|Like I hit the lotto, spent the bag on a trip|Six or seven thousand just the tag on the fit|I sent her outta town with some cash and a kiss|So she don't even ask what I stashed in the whip, mm|Real block boys gon' supply him in person|Ten niggas on one block tryna find 'em a purpose|So just to triple my chances went to hire some workers|Really ain't shit changed, they just buy 'em in verses|It's hard to sympathise when they tell me they feel like quittin'|Put in half the work I did but they want the cribs that I live in|They bought half the work I bought but still want the price that I'm gettin'|And I did everything but die just to live this life that I'm living|Honourable or militant, it's hard when your bands dwindling|My first robbery, I pointed my can with my hands trembling|Went from Super Bowl week every year to the stand snitching|Got half your childhood friends sitting in San Quentin|Break bread for what? I'm from where hoes willing to fuck|Long as you selling weight and Ace spill in your cup|They get famous on Twitter and think they litter than us|But them lines ain't witty enough, my prices really went up|For bitches, y'all Rez Havens, y'all niggas just spectators|I went hard and I came out sharp a Gillette razors|That disrespect paper and spin a connect paper|That's how you end up with a smile on your neck later|Since they wanna shine I'm coppin' them gold caskets|Y'all little bastards be so backwards, I'm old fashion|Had dope addicts, plus my phone had coke traffic|I was good at more than one sport like Bo Jackson|Plugs 2 nigga, yeah|Fire in the crib man|Fuck Covid, you know what I'm saying?|Long live every black king man, long live George Floyd man|Long live Michael Jackson, Plugs 2|Long live Chine Gun, yeah|Charlie Sloth, you already know what it is man|Plugs 2, we on the wayYou might also like1Embed"
