Eric B. & Rakim,I Ain’t No Joke,1987,"I Ain’t No Joke Lyrics[Verse 1]|I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke|Now I slam it when I'm done and make sure it's broke|When I'm gone no one gets on 'cause I won't let|Nobody press up and mess up the scene I set|I like to stand in a crowd and watch the people wonder, damn|But think about it then you'll understand|I'm just an addict, addicted to music|Maybe it's a habit, I gotta use it|Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm|I hook a beat up, convert it into hip-hop form|Write a rhyme in graffiti in every show you see me in|Deep concentration 'cause I'm no comedian|Jokers are wild if you wanna be tame|I treat you like a child then you're gonna be named|Another enemy, not even a friend of me|'Cause you'll get fried in the end when you pretend to be|Competing 'cause I just put your mind on pause|And I can beat you when you compare my rhyme with yours|I wake you up, and as I stare in your face, you seem stunned|Remember me? The one you got your idea from?|But soon you start to suffer, the tune'll get rougher|When you start to stutter, that's when you had enough of|Biting it'll make you choke, you can't provoke|You can't cope, you should've broke because I ain't no joke|[Verse 2]|I got a question as serious as cancer|Who can keep the average dancer|Hyper as a heart attack? Nobody smiling|'Cause you're expressing the rhyme that I'm styling|This is what we all sit down to write|You can't make it, so you take it home, break it and bite|Use pieces and bits of all my hip-hop hits|Get the style down pat, then it's time to switch|Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours|Then you figure you're ready for the neighborhood tours|The E-M-C-E-E, don't even try to be|When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me|You like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate|Then change the rhyme around, that can aggravate me|So when you see me come up, freeze|Or you'll be one of those seven emcees|They think that I'm a new jack but only if they knew that|They who think wrong are they who can't do that|Style that I'm doing, they might ruin|Patterns of paragraphs based on you and|Your off-beat DJ, if anything he play sound familiar|I'll wait 'til E say, ""Play 'em""|So I'ma have to diss and broke|You could get a smack for this, I ain't no joke|You might also like[Verse 3]|I hold the microphone like a grudge|B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge|I hold a conversation 'cause what I invent|I nominated my DJ for president|When I emcee, I'll keep a freestyle going steadily|So pucker up and whistle my melody|But whatever you do, don't miss one|There'll be another rough rhyme after this one|Before you know it, you're following and fiending|Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning|Like before the moral of my story I'm telling|Nobody beats the R, so stop yelling|Save it, put it in your pocket for later|'Cause I'm moving the crowd, and B'll wreck the fader|No interruptions, and the mic is broke|When I'm gone, then you can joke|'Cause everything is real, on a serious tip|Keep playing and I get furious quick|And I'll take you for a walk through hell|Freeze your dome, then watch your eyeballs swell|Guide you out of triple-stage darkness|When it get dark again, then I'ma spark this microphone|'Cause the heat is on, you see smoke|And I'm finished when the beat is gone, I'm no joke34Embed"

suggest|That I'm dropping bombs, but I stay peace and calm|Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm|And I'll break, when I'm through breaking, I'll leave you broke|Drop the mic when I'm finished and watch it smoke|So stand back, you wanna rap, all of that can wait|I won't push, I won't beat around the bush|I wanna break upon those who are not supposed to|You might try, but you can't get close to|Because I'm number one, competition is none|I'm measured with the heat that's made by sun|Whether playing ball or bobbing in the hall|Or just writing my name in graffiti on the wall|They shouldn't have told me you said you control me|So now a contest is what you owe me|Pull out your money, pull out your cut|Pull up a chair...|My name is Rakim Allah, and R and A stands for ""Ra""|Switch it

no interruption|When I approach, I exercise like a coach|Using a melody and add numerous notes|And with the mic and the R-A-K-I-M|It's attached, like a match, I will strike again|Rhymes are poetically

Who do I invade?|Bullets of Teflon, bulletproof vest rip|Tear ya outta ya frame with a bag full of clips|Cause I got a family that waits for my return|To get back home is my main concern|I'ma get back to New York in one piece|But I'm bent in the sand that is hot as the city streets|Sky lights up like fireworks blind me|Bullets, whistlin over my head remind me...|President Bush said attack|Flashback to Nam, I might not make it back|Missile hits the area, screams wake me up|From a war of dreams, heat up the M-16|Basic training, trained for torture|Take no prisoners, and I just caught ya|Addicted to murder, send more bodybags|They can't identify em, leave the nametags|I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor|CASUALTIES OF WAR! (4X)|Day divides the night and night divides the day|It's all hard work and no play|More than combat, it's far beyond that|Cause I got a kill or be killed kind of attack|Area's mapped out, there'll be no, Stratego|Me and my platoon make a boom wherever we go|But what are we here for? Who's on the other side of the wall?|Somebody give the President a call|But I hear warfare scream through the air|Back to the battlegrounds, it's war they declare|A Desert Storm: let's see who reigns supreme|Something like Monopoly: a government scheme|Go to the Army, be all you can be|Another dead soldier? Hell no, not me|So I start letting off ammunition in every direction|Allah is my only protection|But wait a minute, Saddam Hussein prays the same|And this is Asia, from where I came|I'm on the wrong side, so change the target|Shooting at the general; and where's the sergeant?|Blame it on John Hardy Hawkins for bringing me to America|Now it's mass hysteria|I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor|CASUALTIES OF WAR! (4X)||The war is over, for now at least|Just because they lost it don't mean it's peace|It's a long way home, it's a lot to think about|Whole generation, left in doubt|Innocent families killed in the midst|It'll be more dead people after this|So I'm glad to be alive and walkin|Half of my platoon came home in coffins|Except the general, buried in the Storm|In bits and pieces no need to look for em|I played it slick and got away with it|Rigged it up so they would think they did it|Now I'm home on reserves and you can bet|When THEY call, I'm going AWOL|Cause it ain't no way I'm going back to war|When I don't know who or what I'm fighting for|So I wait for terrorists to attack|Every time a truck backfires I fire back|I look for shelter when a plane is over me|Remember Pearl Harbor? New York could be over, G|Kamikaze, strapped with bombs|No peace in the East, they want revenge for Saddam|Did I hear gunshots, or thunder?|No time to wonder, somebody's going under|Put on my fatigues and my camoflouge|Take control, cause I'm in charge|When I snapped out of it, it was blood, dead bodies on the floor|CASUALTIES OF WAR!
