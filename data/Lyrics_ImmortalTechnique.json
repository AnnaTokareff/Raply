    "plain": "On \u201cDance with the Devil,\u201d Immortal Technique spits a fiendish, yet remarkable, story that is allegedly based on a true life story. It tells the tale of a teenager who had large dreams and wanted to receive respect from those considered \u201creal thugs\u201d, and ends with a disturbing twist. The message that is sent to the listeners is to not dance with the devil; a metaphor for showing your willingness to commit crimes to raise your status. The sampled piano beat from the 1970 track \u201cTheme from Love Story\u201d gives the song a dark and sinister vibe.\n\nThe song includes the hidden track \u201cDiabolical.\u201d"

       "plain": "On \u201cDance with the Devil,\u201d Immortal Technique spits a fiendish, yet remarkable, story that is allegedly based on a true life story. It tells the tale of a teenager who had large dreams and wanted to receive respect from those considered \u201creal thugs\u201d, and ends with a disturbing twist. The message that is sent to the listeners is to not dance with the devil; a metaphor for showing your willingness to commit crimes to raise your status. The sampled piano beat from the 1970 track \u201cTheme from Love Story\u201d gives the song a dark and sinister vibe.\n\nThe song includes the hidden track \u201cDiabolical.\u201d"

   "lyrics": "Dance with the Devil Lyrics[Part I: Dance with the Devil]\n\n[Verse 1]\nI once knew a nigga whose real name was William\nHis primary concern was makin' a million\nBein' the illest hustler that the world ever seen\nHe used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams\nA corrupted young mind at the age of 13\nNigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend\nShe put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober\nHer son's heart simultaneously grew colder\nHe started hangin' out, sellin' bags in the projects\nCheckin' the young chicks, lookin' for hit-and-run prospects\nHe was fascinated by material objects\nBut he understood money never bought respect\nHe built a reputation, 'cause he could hustle and steal\nBut got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal\nSo criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real\nYou see, me and niggas like this have never been equal\nI don't project my insecurities on other people\nHe fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles\nSo he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil\nA feeble-minded young man with infinite potential\nThe product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental\nCoincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed\nDancin' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed\nBut he was sick of sellin' trees and gave in to his greed\n[Hook]\nEveryone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences\nYou probably only did a month for minor offenses\nAsk a nigga doin' life if he had another chance\nBut then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance\nDance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block\nBut that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock\nDevils used to be God's angels that fell from the top\nThere's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo Billy started robbin' niggas, anything he could do\nTo get his respect back in the eyes of his crew\nStartin' fights over little shit up on the block\nStepped up to sellin' mothers and brothers the crack rock\nWorkin' overtime for makin' money for the crack spot\nHit the jackpot, and wanted to move up to cocaine\nFulfillin' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain\nTired of the block niggas treatin' him the same\nHe wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs\nBut when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love\nThey told him any motherfuckin' coward can sell drugs\nAny bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs\nAny nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood\nEven Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club\nBut only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die\nStandin' in front of them, starin' straight into their eyes\nBilly realized that these men were well-guarded\nAnd they wanted to test him before business started\nSuggested rapin' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted\nSo now he had a choice between goin' back to his life\nOr makin' money with made men up in the cyph'\nHis dreams about cars and ice made him agree\nA hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be\nAnd so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three\nYou might also like[Hook]\nEveryone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences\nYou probably only did a month for minor offenses\nAsk a nigga doin' life if he had another chance\nBut then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance\nDance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block\nBut that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock\nDevils used to be God's angels that fell from the top\nThere's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey drove around the projects slow while it was rainin'\nSmokin' blunts, drinkin' and jokin' for entertainment\nUntil they saw a woman on the street, walkin' alone\nThree in the mornin', comin' back from work, on her way home\nAnd so they quietly got out the car and followed her\nWalkin' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her\nThey wrapped her shirt around her head\nAnd knocked her onto the floor\n\"This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw\"\nSo Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair\nAnd dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there\nShe struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs\nThey got to the roof and then held her down on the ground\nScreamin', \"Shut the fuck up, and stop movin' around!\"\nThe shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed\nSo Billy stomped on the bitch until he'd broken her jaw\nThe dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin'\nThey kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin'\nBlood leakin' through the cloth, she cried silently\nAnd then they all proceeded to rape her violently\nBilly was made to go first, but each of them took a turn\nRippin' her up and chokin' her until her throat burned\nHer broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned\nWhen they were done and she was lyin'\nBloody, broken and bruised\nOne of them niggas pulled out a brand new .22\nThey told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through\nAnd if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew\nHe thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead\nAnd so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head\n[Sample]\nI'm fallin' and I can't turn back\nI'm fallin' and I can't turn back\n\n[Verse 4]\nRight before he pulled the trigger and ended her life\nHe thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice\nAnd he felt strong standin' along with his new brothers\nCocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover\nBut what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter\n'Cause he was starin' into the eyes of his own mother\nShe looked back at him and cried 'cause he had forsaken her\nShe cried more painfully than when they were rapin' her\nHis whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate\nHis corruption had successfully changed his fate\nAnd he remembered how his mom used to come home late\nWorkin' hard for nothin', because now what was he worth?\nHe turned away from the woman that had once given him birth\nAnd cryin' out to the sky, 'cause he was lonely and scared\nBut only the Devil responded, 'cause God wasn't there\nAnd right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold\nAnd so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul\nThey say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it\nAfter that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it\nAnd listen, 'cause the story that I'm tellin' is true\n'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too\nAnd now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go\nIn fact, I'm sure he's standin' among one of you at my shows\nAnd every street cypher, listenin' to little thugs flow\nHe could be standin' right next to you, and you wouldn't know\nThe Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked\nWhite, brown, yellow and black \u2014 color is not restricted\nYou have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflicted\nAnd you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top\nThere's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot\nSo when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never\nBecause a dance with the Devil might last you forever\n[Part II: \"I\"]\n[Intro: Immortal Technique]\nOh, y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh?\nWell, it\u2019s not, you didn\u2019t count on a fallen angel gettin' back\nInto the grace of God and comin' after you\nY\u2019all niggas ain\u2019t shit, your producers ain\u2019t shit\nYour fuckin' A & R ain\u2019t shit\nI\u2019ll fuckin' wipe my ass with your demo deal\nYo, Diabolic, take this motherfucker\u2019s head off!\n\n[Verse 1: Diabolic]\nGo \u2018head and grip Glocks\nI\u2019ll snap your trigger finger in six spots\nYou\u2019ll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots\nI\u2019ll watch you topple flat\nPut away your rings and holla back\nCan\u2019t freestyle; you\u2019re screwed off the top, like bottle caps\nBeneath the surface\nI\u2019m overheatin' your receiving circuits\nBy unleashin' deeper verses than priests speak in churches\nWhat you preach is worthless\nYour worship defeat the purpose\nLike President Bush takin' bullets for the secret service\nBeyond what y'all fathom, I shit on cats and jaw tap 'em\nShow no compassion, like havin' a straight-faced orgasm\nTour jack 'em, have his half-a-10 bitch suck my friend\u2019s dick\nIn the meantime, you can french kiss this clenched fist\nDiabolic: a one-man brigade spreadin' cancer plague\nFist-fuckin\u2019 a pussy\u2019s face, holdin' a hand grenade\nSo if I catch you bluffin', faggot, you\u2019re less than nothin'\nI just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction\n\n[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\nYou motherfuckers are nothin', you cannot harm me\nI\u2019ll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army\nStorm the planet, huntin' you down, 'cause I\u2019m on a mission\nTo split your body into a billion one-celled organisms\nImmortal Technique\u2019ll destroy your religion, you stupid bitch\nYou\u2019re faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix\nI\u2019m 'bout to blow up, like NASA Challenger computer chips\nArsenic language transmitted revolutionarily\nI\u2019m like time itself: I\u2019m gonna kill you inevitably\nChemically bomb you, fuck usin\u2019 a chrome piece\nI\u2019m Illmatic, you won\u2019t make it home, like Jerome\u2019s niece\nI\u2019ll sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' me\nAnd then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy\nThis puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology\nSo you\u2019re nothin', like diversity without equality\nAnd your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology\nUsin' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven\nProduces more digits than 22 divided by seven\nYou\u2019re like Kevin Spacey: your style is usually suspect\nYou never killed a cop, you, not a motherfuckin' thug yet\nYour mind is empty and spacious\nLike the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist\nFace it, you\u2019re too basic, you\u2019re never gonna make it\nLike children walkin' through Antarctica, butt-naked169Embed"

   "lyrics": "You Never Know Lyrics[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]\nShe was on her way to becomin' a college graduate\nWouldn't even stop to talk to the average kid\nThe type of Latina I'd sit and contemplate marriage with\nFuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hire\nDisciplined, intellectual beauty is what I desire\nFlyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez\nEveryone told me, kickin' it to her was hopeless\nAt first I just thought she didn't mess with broke kids\nThe thug niggas always talkin' about how they smoke kids\nBut the rich sniff-coke kids got no play\n\"I'm not even interested\" is what her body language would say\nEveryone around the way gave up tryin' to get in it\nIt didn't matter how good your game was, she wasn't with it\nOn the block, bitches was jealous but wouldn't admit it\nTalk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it\nCause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it\nAnd no one ever gave them shit except McDonald's and did-dick\nSmokin' weed, with thoughts of envy whenever they lit it\nShe spoke intelligently and they bit it, always tryin' to copy\nBut when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy\nShe had a style, all her own, respectful and pure\nI was sick in the head for her, and there wasn't a cure\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nDon't you know that time waits for no man?\nMy fate, it's all planned\nI'm blessed just to know you\nI've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night\nCan't find a reason why\nGod came between you and I\nAnd if I had the chance again, I'd never let you go\nHold tight to your love, \u2018cause you never know\n\n[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\nHer eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sad\nI used to talk to her occasionally, and she was glad\nThat I wasn't just another nigga tryin' to get in it\nSo every now and then we'd stop and talk for a minute\nI didn't have a gimmick, so the minutes turned to hours\nOn her birthday I gave her a poem with flowers\nThen I took her out to dinner after her cousin's baby shower\nWe talked about power to the people and such\nWe spent more time together, but it was never enough\nI never tried to sneak a touch or even cop a feel\nI was too interested in keepin' it real\nPerfectly honest and complete\nShe would always call me \"cari\u00f1o\" and never Technique\nBought me a new book to read every two or three weeks\nForever changin' the expression of my thoughts when I speak\nIt was because of her I even deaded all of my freaks\nShe convinced me to stop hangin' out on the streets\nTo stop robbin' and stealin' from people like you\nInstead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo\nMuseo del Barrio, and the Metropolitan too\nGot to the point when I was either with her or my crew\nSo I decided one day to tell her my feelings was true\nI couldn't live without her, so I told her, facin' my fears\nBut honey's only response was a face full of tears\nShe could only sob hysterically, holdin' me tight\nI tried to speak, but she wouldn't stop until I left sight\nI felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light\nExcept I didn't burn, I turned cold after that night\nYou might also like[Hook: Jean Grae]\nDon't you know that time waits for no man?\nMy fate, it's all planned\nI'm blessed just to know you\nI've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night\nCan't find a reason why\nGod came between you and I\nAnd if I had the chance again, I'd never let you go\nHold tight to your love, \u2018cause you never know\n\n[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]\nI went on with my life, college and my career\nEnded up locked up like an animal for a year\nWhere the C.O.'s talk to you like they were the overseer\nThen I got sent to the hole when my exit was near\nAt night in my cell, I'd close my eyes and I'd see her\nHold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared\nJust an empty cell until the state gave me parole\nIn the summer, came back, intact and on track\nBut the fact of the matter is I still felt cold\nEven after my mother hugged me, cryin' at home\nMy real niggas would catch me thinkin', outta my zone\nFuckin' lots of different women, but I still felt alone\nRelatively well-known around the New York underground\nBut I kept thinkin' of her and how we used to be down\nThe sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair\nThough gone physically, somehow it was still there\nI had to do somethin' because the shit was too much to bear\nSo I went and visited the building where she used to live\nThe world looks a lot different after you do a bid\nThe way your life done changed\nWhile primitive minds are still stuck in the same game\nLike her cousin who was on the corner, slangin' cocaine\nStepped in the lobby, and tapped the button next to her last name\nHer mom buzzed me up and hugged me up like a mother oughta\nBut her facial expression changed\nWhen I asked about her daughter\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nDon't you know that time waits for no man?\nMy fate, it's all planned\nI'm blessed just to know you\nI've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night\nCan't find a reason why\nGod came between you and I\nAnd if I had the chance again, I'd never let you go\nHold tight to your love, \u2018cause you never know\n\n[Verse 4: Immortal Technique]\nShe told me that there was a note, for me, that was left behind\nAnd she had left it there waitin' for such a long time\nI was inclined to ask about it, but she brought it up first\nI saw a tear swellin' up in her eye, and then she cursed\nShe told me where the letter was, and I started thinkin' the worst\nReversed my position, stepped over and opened the door\nAnd sure enough there was an envelope\nWith my name on the floor: \"Nobody loves you more than me, cari\u00f1o,\" is what the letter said\n\"By the time you get to read this, I'll probably be dead\nBut when you left in '97, a part of me went to Heaven\nI thank God at least I got to know what love really was\nBut it hurt me to see what true love really does\n\u2018Cause even though we never made love\nYou were all that there was\nIt was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave\nYou made me doubt the way I thought\nYou made me want to believe\nAnd then I slipped up, and I let you get close to me\nIt was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me\nThis was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be\nBaby, don't you see?\nI had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV\nHope didn't exist for me since late in 1993\nI died a virgin, I wish I could've given myself to you\nI cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you\nPromise that you'll meet me in Paradise inevitably\nNo matter what, I'll keep your love forever with me.\"\nWhat happened for the rest of the day is still a blur\nBut I remember wishin' that I was dead, instead of her\nShe was buried on August 3rd\nThe story ends without a sequel; and now you know why Technique don't fuckin' fall in love with people\nHold the person that you love closely if they're next to you\nThe one you love, not the person that'll simply have sex with you\nAppreciate them to the fullest extent and then beyond\n\u2018Cause you never really know what you got until it's gone42Embed"

I'm the best of both worlds\nWithout the hidden camera, and the 12-year-old girl\nLet's face it, you're basic, you aren't half the man that I am\nI'll throw your gang sign up, and then I'll spit on my hand\nGimme a hundred grand! Gimme your watch! Gimme your chain!\nThat's your girl? Bitch, get over here! Gimme some brain!\nI'll bust off on her face, and right after the segment\nShe'll probably rub it in her pussy, tryna get herself pregnant\nI said it, I meant it, that's the way I deal with enemies\nLike pro-lifers that support the death penalty\nAnd don't talk about war when niggas know that you puss\nA fuckin' hypocrite, draft-dodger like George Bush\nDon't push me, nigga, 'cause I'm close to the edge\nAnd I'll jump off with a rope that's wrapped around ya head\nSend a dead fetus to my ex on Valentine's Day\nThe safety's off, nigga, so get the fuck out my way!\n[Hook]\nObnoxious, nigga, murderous lyrics, I know that you hear it (Yeah)\nNow that I'm gettin' closer and closer, I know that you feel it (Yeah)\nYou're eatin' off rap, and I hope you choke on your gimmick\nNiggas said Hip-Hop was dead, but I'm invokin' a spirit\nWe takin' it back in the day to the Golden Age\nWhen wack motherfuckers used to get thrown off stage\nImmortal Technique, I made this to bump in your ride\nOr burn it off the Internet and bump it outside\nNigga, we keepin' it live, we keepin' it live\nWe keepin' it live, we keepin' it live\nBurn it off the fuckin' Internet and bump it outside (Yeah nigga!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook, motherfucker, my words damage and slaughter\nA ragin' alcoholic like the President's daughters\nDisgustin' flow, like third-world-country tap water\nBut before I hit the border, someone give me a quarter\n'Cause I'ma prank call COP-SHOT just for kicks\nPayback for every time that they called me a spic\nAnd Puerto-Rican chicks tell me that I fuck like I'm loco\nAnd Dominican women call me the \"Rompe Toto\"\nThey call me \"ocioso,\" I'd rather get fired than quit\nI get unemployment, you work, and we makin' the same shit\nHow dare you niggas criticize the way that I spit?\nYou coffee-shop revolutionary son of a bitch!\nBut you know what the fuck I think is just pathetic and gay?\nWhen niggas speculate what the fuck 'Pac would say\nYou don't know shit about a dead man's perspective\nAnd talkin' shit'll get your neck bone disconnected\nDisrespected, niggas don't show no love\nWhy you tryna be hardcore, you fuckin' homo thug?\nAnd don't be sensitive and angry at the shit that I wrote\n'Cause if you can take a fuckin' dick, you can take a joke\nI'll choke your friends in front of you to prove that you've fallen off\nAnd you won't do shit about it like the Church during the Holocaust\nKalashnikov machine gun flow that I fire\nObnoxious until they shoot me on the day I retire\nYou might also like[Hook]\nObnoxious, nigga, murderous lyrics, I know that you hear it\nNow that I'm gettin' closer and closer, I know that you feel it\nYou're eatin' off rap, and I hope you choke on your gimmick\nNiggas said Hip-Hop was dead, but I'm invokin' a spirit\nWe takin' it back in the day to the Golden Age\nWhen wack motherfuckers used to get thrown off stage\nImmortal Technique, I made this to bump in your ride\nOr burn it off the Internet and bump it outside\nNigga, we keepin' it live, we keepin' it live\nWe keepin' it live, we keepin' it live\nBurn it off the fuckin' Internet and bump it outside, ha-ha-ha (Yeah nigga!)\n\n[Verse 3]\nDamn, homie! In high school I beat the shit out of you and your man, homie\nYour girl wanna blow me, and don't even know me\nShe lonely, and she think you a phony\nI take a piss on a development deal from Sony\nOr Def Jam, 'cause you're like all of the rest, man\nThis ain't a verse, this is shit-talk at the end of the song\nAnd you can suck a dick if you think I ended it wrong\nFuck you and I'm gone, ha-ha-ha-ha! (Fuck y'all niggas)\n\n[Outro]\nPeace to the Stronghold, EOW (Cut)\nWord-A-Mouf, Forbidden Chapters\nIAK niggas, Wax Poe, killin' you slow\nThe Plague, I'll murder a show, you don't even know\nYeah, foul play nigga\nHa-ha-ha, Harlem, woah!13Embed"

   "lyrics": "The Cause of Death Lyrics[Intro]\nImmortal Technique\nRevolutionary Vol. 2, yeah\nBroadcasting live from Harlem, New York (Yeah)\nLet the truth be known\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou better watch what the fuck flies out of your mouth\nOr I'ma hijack a plane and fly it into your house\nBurn your apartment with your family tied to the couch\nAnd slit your throat so when you scream only blood comes out\nI doubt that there could ever be a more wicked MC\n'Cause AIDS-infested child molesters aren't sicker than me\nI see the world for what it is, beyond the white and the black\nThe way the government downplays historical facts\n'Cause the United States sponsored the rise of the Third Reich\nJust like the CIA trained terrorists how to fight\nBuild bombs and sneak box cutters onto a flight\nWhen I was a child, the Devil himself bought me a mic\nBut I refused the offer, 'cause God sent me to strike\nWith skills unused like fallopian tubes on a dyke\nMy words'll expose George Bush and bin Laden\nAs two separate parts of the same seven-headed dragon\nAnd you can't fathom the truth so you don't hear me\nYou think Illuminati's just a fuckin' conspiracy theory?\nThat's why conservative racists are all runnin' shit\nAnd your phone is tapped by the federal government\nSo I'm jammin' frequencies in your brain when you speak to me\nTechnique\u2019ll rip a rapper to pieces indecently\nPack weapons illegally, 'cause I'm never hesitant\nSniper-scopin' a commission controllin' the president\n[Chorus]\nFather, forgive them, for they don't know right from wrong\nThe truth\u2019ll set you free, written down in this song\nAnd the song has the cause of death written in code\nThe word of God brought to life, that'll save your soul\nSave your soul, motherfucker, save your soul\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nI hacked the Pentagon for self-incriminating evidence\nOf Republican-manufactured white powder pestilence\nMarines Corps flak vest, with the guns and ammo\nSpittin' bars like a demon stuck inside a piano\nTurn a Sambo into a soldier, with just one line\nSo here's the truth about the system that'll fuck up your mind\nThey gave al-Qaeda six billion dollars in 1989 to 1992\nAnd now the last chapters of Revelations are comin' true\nAnd I know a lot of people find it hard to swallow this\n'Cause subliminal bigotry makes you hate my politics\nBut you act like America wouldn't destroy two buildings\nIn a country that was sponsoring bombs dropped on our children\nI was watchin' the towers, and though I wasn't the closest\nI saw them crumble to the earth like they were full of explosives\nAnd they thought nobody noticed the news report that they did\nAbout the bombs planted on the George Washington Bridge\nFour non-Arabs arrested during the emergency\nAnd then it disappeared from the news permanently\nThey dubbed a tape of Osama, and they said it was proof\nJealous of our freedom? I can't believe you bought that excuse!\nRockin' a motherfuckin' flag don't make you a hero\nWord to Ground Zero\nThe Devil crept into Heaven, God overslept on the seventh\nThe New World Order was born on September 11th\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nFather, forgive them, for they don't know right from wrong\nThe truth\u2019ll set you free, written down in this song\nAnd the song has the cause of death written in code\nThe word of God brought to life, that'll save your soul\nSave your soul, motherfucker, save your soul\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd just so conservatives don't take it to heart\nI don't think Bush did it, 'cause he isn't that smart\nHe's just a stupid puppet takin' orders on his cell phone\nFrom the same people that sabotaged Senator Wellstone\nThe military industry got it poppin' and lockin'\nLookin' for a way to justify the Wolfowitz Doctrine\nAnd as a matter of fact, Rumsfeld, now that I think back\nWithout 9/11, you couldn't have a war in Iraq\nOr a defense budget of world conquest proportions\nKill freedom of speech and revoke the right to abortion\nTax cut extortion, a blessing to the wealthy and wicked\nBut you still have to answer to the Armageddon you scripted\nAnd Dick Cheney, you fuckin' leech, tell \u2018em your plans\nAbout building your pipelines through Afghanistan\nAnd how Israeli troops trained the Taliban in Pakistan\nYou might have some house niggas fooled, but I understand\nColonialism is sponsored by corporations\nThat's why Halliburton gets paid to rebuild nations\nTell me the truth, I don't scare into paralysis\nI know the CIA saw bin Laden on dialysis\nIn '98 when he was top ten for the FBI\nGovernment ties is really why the government lies\nRead it yourself instead of askin' the government why\n'Cause then the cause of death'll cause the propaganda to die\n[Outro]\nFather\nForgive them\n\n[Sample]\nHe is scheduled for 60 Minutes next. He\u2019s going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television. People everywhere are starting to listen to him. It's embarrassing\u201413Embed"

Edgar Hoover politicians dress up in drag\nTryna confuse you, makin' it hard to follow this:\nCapitalism and democracy are not synonymous\nYou swallow propaganda like a birth control pill\nSellin' your soul to the eye on the back of the dollar bill\nBut that'll never be me 'cause I'm leavin' the past\nLike an abused wife with the kids, leavin' your ass\nLike a drug addict clean and sober, leavin' the stash\nUnbreakable Technique, leavin' the plane crash\nI'm out with the black box and I refuse to return\nI spit reality instead of what you usually learn\nAnd I refuse to be concerned with condescending advice\n'Cause I'm the only motherfucker that could change my life\nYou might also like[Trumpet Solo]\n\n[Outro]\nSome people think I won't make it, but I know that I will\nEscape the emptiness 'cause that shit is slow and it kills\nThe flow and the skill, I made y'all believe it at last\nYou can make the future, but it starts with leavin' the past\n\n[Trumpet Solo]11Embed"

   "lyrics": "The Poverty of Philosophy Lyrics[Verse 1]\nMost of my Latino and black people who are struggling to get food, clothes and shelter in the hood are so concerned with that, that philosophising about freedom and socialist democracy is usually unfortunately beyond their rationale. They don't realize that America can't exist without separating them from their identity, because if we had some sense of who we really are, there's no way in hell we'd allow this country to push it's genocidal consensus on our homelands. This ignorance exists, but it can be destroyed\nNiggas talk about change and working within the system to achieve that\nThe problem with always being a conformist is that when you try to change the system from within, it's not you who changes the system; it's the system that will eventually change you\nThere is usually nothing wrong with compromise in a situation, but compromising yourself in a situation is another story completely And I have seen this happen long enough in the few years that I've been alive to know that it's a serious problem\nLatino America is a huge colony of countries whose presidents are cowards in the face of economic imperialism\nYou see, third world countries are rich places, abundant in resources, and many of these countries have the capacity to feed their starving people and the children we always see digging for food in trash on commercials\nBut plutocracies, in other words a government run by the rich such as this one and traditionally oppressive European states, force the third world into buying overpriced, unnecessary goods while exporting huge portions of their natural resources\nI'm quite sure that people will look upon my attitude and sentiments and look for hypocrisy and hatred in my words\nMy revolution is born out of love for my people, not hatred for others\nYou see, most of Latinos are here because of the great inflation that was caused by American companies in Latin America\nAside from that, many are seeking a life away from the puppet democracies that were funded by the United States\nPlaces like El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Colombia, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Republica Dominicana, and not just Spanish-speaking countries either, but Haiti and Jamaica as well\nAs different as we have been taught to look at each other by colonial society, we are in the same struggle and until we realize that, we'll be fighting for scraps from the table of a system that has kept us subservient instead of being self-determined\nAnd that's why we have no control over when the embargo will stop in Cuba, or when the bombs will stop dropping in Vieques\nBut you see, here in America the attitude that is fed to us is that outside of America there live lesser people\n\"Fuck them, let them fend for themselves.\" No, fuck you, they are you\nNo matter how much you want to dye your hair blonde and put fake eyes in, or follow an anorexic standard of beauty, or no matter how many diamonds you buy from people who exploit your own brutally to get them, no matter what kind of car you drive or what kind of fancy clothes you put on, you will never be them\nThey're always gonna look at you as nothing but a little monkey. I'd rather be proud of what I am, rather than desperately trying to be something I'm really not, just to fit in\nAnd whether we want to accept it or not, that's what this culture or lack of culture is feeding us\nI want a better life for my family and for my children, but it doesn't have to be at the expense of millions of lives in my homeland. We're given the idea that if we didn't have these people to exploit then America wouldn't be rich enough to let us have these little petty material things in our lives and basic standards of living\nNo, that's wrong. It's the business giants and the government officials who make all the real money\nWe have whatever they kick down to us\nMy enemy is not the average white man, it's not the kid down the block or the kids I see on the street; my enemy is the white man I don't see: the people in the white house, the corporate monopoly owners, fake liberal politicians those are my enemies\nThe generals of the armies that are mostly conservatives those are the real motherfuckers that I need to bring it to\nNot the poor, broke country-ass soldier that's too stupid to know shit about the way things are set up\nIn fact, I have more in common with most working- and middle-class white people than I do with most rich black and Latino people\nAs much as racism bleeds America, we need to understand that classism is the real issue.\nMany of us are in the same boat and it's sinking, while these bougie motherfuckers ride on a luxury liner, and as long as we keep fighting over kicking people out of the little boat we're all in, we're gonna miss an opportunity to gain a better standard of living as a whole\nIn other words, I don't want to escape the plantation\nI want to come back, free all my people, hang the motherfucker that kept me there and burn the house to the god damn ground\nI want to take over the encomienda and give it back to the people who work the land\nYou cannot change the past but you can make the future, and anyone who tells you different is a fucking lethargic devil\nI don't look at a few token Latinos and black people in the public eye as some type of achievement for my people as a whole\nMost of those successful individuals are sellouts and house negroes\nYou might also likeBut, I don't consider brothers a sell-out if they move out of the ghetto\nPoverty has nothing to do with our people. It's not in our culture to be poor\nThat's only been the last 500 years of our history; look at the last 2000 years of our existence and what we brought to the world in terms of science, mathematics, agriculture, and forms of government\nYou know the idea of a confederation of provinces where one federal government controls the states? The Europeans who came to this country stole that idea from the Iroquois League\nThe idea of impeaching a ruler comes from an Aztec tradition. That's why Montezuma was stoned to death by his own people cause he represented the agenda of White Spaniards once he was captured\nNot the Aztec people who would become Mexicans\nSo in conclusion, I'm not gonna vote for anybody just cause they Black or Latino. They have to truly represent the community and represent what's good for all of us proletariat\nPorque sino entonces te mando por el carajo cabron gusano hijo de puta, seramos libre pronto, viva la revolucion, VIVA LA REVOLUCION11Embed"

Industrial revolution\n\n[Verse 2]\nI want fifty-three million dollars for my calloused hands\nLike the Bush administration gave to the Taliban\nAnd fuck packing grams, nigga, learn to speak and behave!\nYou want to spend twenty years as a government slave?\nTwo million people in prison keep the government paid\nStuck in a six-by-eight cell, alive in the grave\nI was made by revolution to speak to the masses\nDeep in the club, toast the truth.  Reach for your glasses\nI'll burn an orphanage just to bring heat to you bastards\nInnocent deep in a casket\u2014Colombian fashion\nIntoxicated off the flow like thug's passion\nYou motherfuckers will never get me to stop blasting\nYou're better off asking Ariel Sharon for compassion\nYou're better off begging for twenty points from a label\nYou're better off battling cancer under telephone cables\nTechnique chemically unstable, set to explode\nForetold by the dead sea scrolls written in code\nSo if your message ain\u2019t shit, fuck the records you sold!\n'Cause if you go platinum, it's got nothing to do with luck\nIt just means that a million people are stupid as fuck\nStuck in the underground, a general that rose to the limit\nWithout distribution managers, a deal, or a gimmick\nRevolutionary Volume 2 murder the critics\nAnd leave your fucking body rotting for the roaches and crickets\nYou might also like[Hook]\nThis is the business, and y'all ain\u2019t getting nothing for free\nAnd if you devils play broke, then I'm taking your company\nYou could call it reparations or restitution\nLock and load, nigga.

It's wild\nListen\n\n[Chorus: Mos Def + Jadakiss]\nBin Laden didn't blow up the projects\nIt was you, nigga\nTell the truth, nigga\nBush knocked down the towers\nTell the truth, nigga\nBush knocked down the towers\nTell the truth, nigga\nBin Laden didn't blow up the projects\nIt was you, nigga\nTell the truth, nigga\nBush knocked down the towers\nTell the truth, nigga\nBush knocked down the towers\n[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]\nI pledge no allegiance, nigga, fuck the President's speeches!\nI'm baptized by America and covered in leeches\nThe dirty water that bleaches your soul and your facial features\nDrownin' you in propaganda that they spit through the speakers\nAnd if you speak about the evil that the government does\nThe Patriot Act'll track you to the type of your blood\nThey try to frame you and say you was tryna sell drugs\nAnd throw a federal indictment on niggas that show you love\nThis shit is run by fake Christians, fake politicians\nLook at they mansions, and look at the conditions you live in\nAll they talk about is terrorism on television\nThey tell you to listen, but they don't really tell you they mission\nThey funded al-Qaeda, and now they blame the Muslim religion\nEven though Bin Laden was a CIA tactician\nThey gave him billions of dollars and they funded his purpose\nFahrenheit 9/11? That's just scratchin' the surface\n\n[Chorus: Mos Def + Jadakiss]\nBin Laden didn't blow up the projects\nIt was you, nigga\nTell the truth, nigga\nBush knocked down the towers\nTell the truth, nigga\nBush knocked down the towers\nTell the truth, nigga\nBin Laden didn't blow up the projects\nIt was you, nigga\nTell the truth, nigga\nBush knocked down the towers\nTell the truth, nigga\nBush knocked down the towers\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\nThey say the rebels in Iraq still fight for Saddam\nBut that's bullshit, I'll show you why it's totally wrong\n'Cause if another country invaded the hood tonight\nIt'd be warfare through Harlem and Washington Heights\nI wouldn't be fightin' for Bush or White America's dream\nI'd be fightin' for my people's survival and self-esteem\nI wouldn't fight for racist churches from the South, my nigga\nI'd be fightin' to keep the occupation out, my nigga\nYou ever clock someone who talk shit or look at you wrong?\nImagine if they shot at you and was rapin' your moms\nAnd of course Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons\nWe sold him that shit after Ronald Reagan's election\nMercenary contractors fightin' a new era\nCorporate military bankin' off the war on terror\nThey controllin' the ghetto with the fear of attack\nTryin' to distract the fact that they engineerin' the crack\nSo I'm strapped like Lee Malvo, holdin' a sniper rifle\nThese bullets will touch your kids, and I don't mean like Michael\nYour body be sent to the morgue, stripped down and recycled\nI fire on house niggas that support you and like you\n'Cause innocent people get murdered in the struggle daily\nAnd poor people never get shit and struggle daily\nThis ain't no alien conspiracy theory, this shit is real\nWritten on the dollar underneath the Masonic seal\n[Interlude: Eminem]\nI don't rap for dead presidents\nI'd rather see the President dead\nIt's never been said, but I set precedents\n\n[Chorus: Mos Def + Jadakiss]\nBin Laden didn't blow up the projects\nIt was you, nigga\nTell the truth, nigga\nBush knocked down the towers\nTell the truth, nigga\nBush knocked down the towers\nTell the truth, nigga\nBin Laden didn't blow up the projects\nIt was you, nigga\nTell the truth, nigga\n\n[Interlude: Eminem]\nShady Records was eighty seconds away from the Towers\nSome cowards fucked with the wrong building\nThey meant to hit ours19Embed"

You see, you are the major purchaser of our national product, which is, of course, coca\u00edna.\"\n\n[Interviewer]\n\"Cocaine. On one hand, you're saying the United States government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the same time, we are doing business with the very same government that is flooding our streets with cocaine?\"\n[Gutierrez]\n\"Mm, mm, si, si. Let me show you a few of the other characters that are involved in this... tragicomedy.\"\n[Spanish Dialogue]\n\"Oigan ustedes ahi! Ustedes trabajando! Sigan trabajando carajo!\"\n\"Oye Luis, \u00bfCu\u00e1ndo van a terminar?\"\n\"Ahorita.\"\n\"Bueno que se apuren los burros. Ahorita viene el cami\u00f3n, ap\u00fara, diles!\"\n\"Ahorita van a venir para recoger los productos, ap\u00farate!\"\n\n[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]\nI'm on the border of Bolivia, working for pennies\nTreated like a slave, the coca fields have to be ready\nThe spirit of my people is starving, broken and sweaty\nDreaming about revolution (\"\u00a1Revolucion!\") looking at my machete\nBut the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms\nAnd if I ran away, I know they'd probably murder my moms\nSo I pray to Jes\u00fa Cristo when I go to the mission\nProcess the cocaine paste and play my position\n\n[Verse 2: Pumpkinhead]\nOk, listen, Juan Valdez, just get me my product\nBefore we chop off your hands for worker's misconduct\nI got the power to shoot a copper and not get charged\nAnd it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad\nSo, to feed your kids I need these bricks\nForty tons in total, let me test it, indeed, I... [sniffs]\nShit, this is good, pass me a tissue\nAnd don't worry about them, I paid off the official\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Diabolic]\nYo, it don't come as a challenge, I'm the son of some of the foulest\nElected by my people, the only one on the ballot\nBorn and bred to consult with feds, I laugh at fate\nAnd assassinate my predecessor to have his place\nIn a Third World fascist state, lock the nation\nWith 90% of the wealth in 10% of the population\nThe Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully\nThe finest type of China white and cocaine, you'll see\n[Verse 4: Tonedeff]\nHoney, I'm home\nNever mind why your bank account's suddenly grown, it's (What?)\nFunny we're so out of this debt from this money we owe, would you\nRun if I told you that I had two governments overthrown\nTo keep our son enrolled in a private school and to keep our tummies swollen? (Whoa)\nCome on, our fucking home was built on a foundation of bloody throats\nThe hungry stolen of their souls, of course this country's running coke\nI took a stunted oath to hush the ones who know\nThe CIA conducts the flow for these young hustlers that lust for dough\n\n[Verse 5: Poison Pen]\nI don't work in the hood.  Hit my connect.  That\u2019s\nWhat's really good.  They supply work to the hood\nThese dudes fucking crack me up\nScrutinized like we inferior.  Petrified when we meet in my area (Calm down)\nMy dudes don\u2019t shoot until I say so.  You got the loot?\nGive me the \"Yay-Yay!\" like Ice Cube, so don't play with\nMy llello\nWe won't stop for you bastards\nMy street scramblers chop it and bag it\n[Verse 6: LouCipher]\nTaking pictures and tapping phones\nDebating snitches and cracking codes\nFast to cuff or blast the fo'\nOn any hustler stacking dough (Get on the ground)\nThere\u2019s probably crack or blow\nAnd my overtime is where your taxes go\nI\u2019ll gain your trust\nGet you to hand weight to us \u2018cause we paid up front\nOn the low with cameras taping ya\nGetting popped with weight? The prison sentence is due\nMake the call and then leave with two kis out the evidence room\n\n[Verse 7: C-Rayz Walz]\nWith my fame, truck, boat, or plane, they watching you\nYou think you got work? They copping too\nWe control blocks, they lock countries and own companies\nWe had nice cars and sneaker money\nNow there's players out there talkin' 'bout they holding\nWith bugs in their house like they down South with windows open\nYour dough ain't long\u2014you wrong\u2014you take shorts and soon\nFeds\u2019ll be up in your mouth like forks and spoons\nSo enjoy the rush, live plush off coke bread\nSoon you'll be in a cell with me like Jenny Lopez\nIn a school, I was a bully, now life is fully a joke\nI keep afloat on a boat for Peruvian coke\nPlayers do favors for governors and tax makers\nFat Quakers smoke crack and sex acts with bad mayors\nThe walls got ears, you bigmouths probably scared\nNot prepared to do years like Javier\n\n[Outro: Immortal Technique]\nThe story just told is an example of the path that drugs take on their way to every neighborhood, in every state, of this country. It's a lot deeper than the niggas on your block. So when they point the finger at you, brother man? This is what you've got to tell them\n\n[Edited Outro Dialogue from New Jack City, 1991: Nino Brown]\n\"I'm not guilty. You're the one that's guilty. The lawmakers, the politicians, the Columbian drug lords... all you who lobby against making drugs legal, just like you did with alcohol during the prohibition! You're the one who's guilty. I mean, c'mon, let's kick the ballistics here: ain't no Uzis made in Harlem! Not one of us in here owns a poppy field! This thing is bigger than Immortal Technique. This is big business. This is the American way.\"12Embed"

Fuck the law, \u2018cause real jail is for suckas\nI go to country club prison, you dumb motherfuckers\n(I am the 1 percent, fuckin' bitch!)\n\n[Hook]\nYou know my CEO, corporate steeze, please\nOverthrow governments overseas in a breeze\nPoliticians in my pockets for a few hundred G's\nSo if I'm ever in court, my assets'll never freeze\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nI got a job and a house and a bank account\nWhen I'm out, I doubt that's something you can say\nAnd if not then I'll fake death like Kenneth Lay\nMake money everyday the world burns on its axis\nWhile y'all strugglin' to pay taxes\nI'm gettin' my money the fastest\nMemos and faxes, shredded up documents\nSlush funds through the corrupt continents\nBut they don't want me indicted\n\u2018Cause they don't want my dirty laundry aired when I fight it\nDon't get my lawyers excited\n\u2018Cause what good is a law if you can't rewrite it?\nI got CIA traitors, dictators\nSo fuck y'all whistleblowers and haters!\n(Sheeeiiitt!) I'll invest money from al-Qaeda\nIn the bank 9/11 widows go to later\nCapitalism's who I pray to, fuck the state of the world\nMoney talks, so what the fuck I need to say to your girl?\n(I don't pay them to fuck, I pay them to leave!)\n\n[Hook 2]\nYou know my CEO, corporate steeze, greed\nI treat countries like the IMF, down on your knees\nReal gangstas run the world, fuck what you believe\nI'll cut down a forest while you niggas burnin' some trees\nI'll get your family murdered for a couple of G's\n\u2018Cause your working class money ain't fuckin' with me\nYou think rappers are rich \u2018cause of songs you heard?\nMy labels make the money and haven't rapped a fuckin' word\n[Verse 3]\nYacht in the ocean, coastin' with the sails out\nHey, America, thanks for the bailouts\nI made off with the Banco Ambrosiano\nGot away scott-free like El Vaticano\nActivists act a bitch, get mad at me\n\u2018Cause of my tax-free charity\n80 percent to the staff and company\nAnd 20 percent to the homeless and hungry\nThe country gotta pay the Fed Reserve\nKick back to the banksters\u2014haven't you learned?\nYou protest cops or patrols on the street\nBut I bought city hall, so I own the police\nEmail, Facebook, and the shit you tweet\nAll the phone companies, so I heard you speak\nAnd my suggestion is your correction\nNo elections, sex with no affection\nNo invention will benefit the world of man\nWill exist 'til I've got the money in my hand\nWorld Bank interest rate damn rape on the spot\nBut I'm a gangsta, you gon' take my money, like it or not, nigga\n(I got your country in my pocket, motherfucker!)\n\n[Hook 3]\nYou know my CEO, masonic steeze, cheese\nOnly little people pay all these taxes and fees\nSince you were born, we've controlled what you watch and you read\nAnd pretty soon we're gonna own the fuckin' air that you breathe\nI take what I want, fucker, I don't have to say please\nI convince you that it's good for you, take it and leave\nYou think presidents are a face of a nation?\nI put 'em all where they are, end of the conversation14Embed"

   "lyrics": "Harlem Streets Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYeah, Harlem streets stay flooded in white powder\nLike those motherfuckers runnin' away from the Twin Towers\nGunshots rock the Earth like a meteor shower\nBowlin' For Columbine, fear givin' the media power\nInnocence devoured like a chicken spot snack box\nGovernment cocaine cooked into ghetto crack rock\nCorrupt cops' false testimony at your arraignment\nCheck to check, constant struggle to make the payments\nWorkin' your whole life, wonderin' where the day went\nThe subway stays packed like a multi-cultural slave ship\nIt's rush hour, 2:30 to 8, non stoppin'\nAnd people comin' home after corporate sharecroppin'\nAnd fuck flossin'! Mothers are tryin' to feed children\nBut gentrification is kickin' them out of their buildin'\nA generation of babies born without healthcare\nFamilies homeless, thrown the fuck off the welfare\n[Chorus: Sample]\n\"Homicide Harlem\u2014blaow! What's the problem?\"\n\"Homicide Harlem\u2014blaow! What's the problem?\"\n\"Homicide Harlem\u2014blaow! What's the problem?\"\n\"Homicide Harlem\u2014blaow! What's the problem?\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's like Cambodia, \"The Killing Fields\" uptown\nWe live in distress and hang the flag upside down\nThe sound of conservative politicians on television\nPeople in the hood are blind, so they tell us to listen\nThey vote for us to go to war instantly\nBut none of their kids serve in the infantry\nThe odds are stacked against us, like a casino\nThink about it: most of the Army is black and Latino\nAnd if you can't acknowledge the reality of my words\nYou just another stupid motherfucker out on the curb\nTryin' to escape from the ghetto with your ignorant ways\nBut you can't read history at an illiterate stage\nAnd you can't raise a family on minimum wage\nWhy the fuck you think most of us are locked in a cage?\nI give niggas the truth, 'cause their pride is indigent\nYou better off rich and guilty than poor and innocent\nBut I'm sick of feelin' impotent watchin' the world burn\nIn the era of apocalypse, waitin' my turn\nI'm a Harlem nigga that's concerned with the future\nAnd if you're in my way it'd be an honor to shoot ya\nUproot ya with the evil that grows in my people\nMakin' them deceitful, cannibalistic, and lethal\nBut I see through the mentality implanted in us\nAnd I educate my fam about who we should trust\nYou might also like[Chorus: Sample]\n\"Homicide Harlem\u2014blaow! What's the problem?\"\n\"Homicide Harlem\u2014blaow! What's the problem?\"\n\"Homicide Harlem\u2014blaow! What's the problem?\"\n\"Homicide Harlem\u2014blaow!

   "lyrics": "Caught in the Hustle Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThey say the odds against me are crooked and impossible\nLike I was born with a hole in my heart as an obstacle\nI was left to die by the doctors in the Children's Hospital\nBut I never lose hope, success is psychological\nThe world is volatile and the street is my education\nShapin' the nation, like the blueprint of a Mason\nWhile Shawshank record deals get you raped on occasion\nSo I'm focused on my economic situation\nI'm like the little kids on TV that dig through the trash\nI hustle regardless of the way you talk shit and laugh\nA lot of niggas drop science, but they don't know the math\nBecause their mind is narrower than the righteous path\nIt's funny how on the block niggas will kill you for cash\nBut never raise the gun and cry out, \"Freedom at last!\"\nThe cold war is over, but the world is still gettin' colder\nAtlas walkin' through the projects, with the hood on my shoulders\nI would like to raise my children to grow to be soldiers\nBut then a general will decide when their life would be over\nSo I work hard until my personality's split\nLike the Black Panthers, into the Bloods and the Crips\nThey said I would never be shit, but now I sit and reminisce\nLike Yeshua ben Yusef flippin' through Genesis\nIgnorance is venomous, and it murders the soul\nSpreadin' like a virus, runnin' rampant, out of control\n[Hook]\nSo if I should ever fall and get caught in the hustle\nLet them know that I died while I fought in a struggle\nFrom the hoodrats to the rich kids lost in a bubble\nSpray paintin' on the streets and at the subway tunnels\nWrite it down and remember that we never gave in\nThe mind of a child is where the revolution begins\nSo if the solution has never been to look in yourself\nHow is it that you expect to find it anywhere else?\n\n[Verse 2]\nImmortal Technique in the streets, back on the hustle\n\u2018Cause three strikes will get you life for stuffin' cracks in a duffle\nUpstate, behind steel gates, attacked in a scuffle\nRazor blades stuck on the side of pencils hacked through your muscle\nBut the emptiness is what bleeds you to death when it cuts you\nAnd it's the lawyers, not the inmates, schemin' to fuck you\nTryna fight the system from inside eventually corrupts you\nBut that's what you get when you put a corporation above you\nAnd it's the people that love you that seem to hurt you the most\nSometimes when they die, you find yourself cursin' their ghost\nBut you make success, nobody delivers your fate\nSometimes you give and you take\nSince prehistoric vertebrates crawled out of the lakes\nAnd that's the truth about life\nOr to do it to ghetto and your car, rims, and your ice\n'Cause even though we survived through the struggle that made us\nWe still look at ourselves through the eyes of people that hate us\nBut I'm going to make it regardless of the trumped up charges\nAnd semi-automatic barrages that empty the cartridge\nPost-traumatically scarred kids that try to be brave\nBecause niggas backstab each other just to try to get paid\nTurn cannibal, like knights during the crusades\nAfraid of responsibility, addicted to greed\nBeatin' their girl, purposefully losin' a seed\nAs if we were bound to the destiny we used to receive\nYou might also like[Hook]\nSo if I should ever fall and get caught in the hustle\nLet them know that I died while I fought in a struggle\nFrom the hoodrats to the rich kids lost in a bubble\nSpray paintin' on the streets and at the subway tunnels\nWrite it down and remember that we never gave in\nThe mind of a child is where the revolution begins\nSo if the solution has never been to look in yourself\nHow is it that you expect to find it anywhere else?\n\n[Bridge/Outro]\nI used to wonder about people who don't believe in themselves\nBut then I saw the way they portrayed us to everyone else\nThey cursed us to only see the worst in ourselves\nBlind to the fact the whole time we were hurtin' ourselves\nI used to wonder about people who don't believe in themselves\nBut then I saw the way they portrayed us to everyone else\nThey cursed us to only see the worst in ourselves\nBlind to the fact the whole time we were hurtin' ourselves\n\nI used to wonder\u2026 {*echo*}10Embed"

It was released on October 27th and had 200,000 downloads on its first day.\n\n\n\nThis song addresses issues such as the dysfunctional political system, corrupt corporations and the twisted messages which news networks brainwash us with; it is not for the faint of heart\u2026\n\nThe instrumental samples \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d by The Beatles, a song that describes \u201call the lonely people\u201d whom the Beatles encounter, and the hollowness that fills their lives."

It was released on October 27th and had 200,000 downloads on its first day.\n\n\n\nThis song addresses issues such as the dysfunctional political system, corrupt corporations and the twisted messages which news networks brainwash us with; it is not for the faint of heart\u2026\n\nThe instrumental samples \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d by The Beatles, a song that describes \u201call the lonely people\u201d whom the Beatles encounter, and the hollowness that fills their lives."

   "lyrics": "The Martyr Lyrics[Intro]\n\"I am content to die for my beliefs\nSo cut off my head and make me a martyr!\nThe people will always remember it.\"\n\"No, they will forget.\"\n\nA man who walks with God can walk anywhere\nHence I fear nothing\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe point of guerilla war is not to succeed\nIt's always been just to make the enemy bleed\nDeprivin' the soldiers of the peace of mind that they need\nBullets are hard to telegraph when they bob and they weave\nThe only way a guerilla war can ever be over\nIs when the occupation can't afford more soldiers\nUntil they have to draft the last of you into the service\nAnd you refuse because you don't see the purpose\nThe only way to counter the insurgents that are well-equipped\nIs to paint the people fightin' for freedom as \"terrorists\"\nThen find a faction, lookin' for foreign investment\nInstall them in power and murder any objections\nYou can't stop a revolution from breathin'\nSo to beat 'em, they offer people the illusion of freedom\nBut when you're done dreamin' and wake up tortured for treason\nThen you can see them, hidin' behind the god they believe in\n[Hook]\nDeep in the trenches, in the heart of a war\nThat's the place a martyr is born (Motherfucker, it's on!)\nDuring the night before the start of the dawn\nThat's the place a martyr is born (Motherfucker, it's on!)\nWhen gunshots are raining in the heart of a storm\nThat's the place a martyr is born (Motherfucker, it's on!)\nGuerilla war when the army is gone\nThat's the place a martyr is born (Motherfucker, it's on!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe purpose of life is a life with a purpose\nSo I'd rather die for a cause than live a life that is worthless\nI don't need the circus or the day of national observance\nI need you to think for you and stop bein' a servant\nPawns only move a square in the game that they're used in\nAnd realize it too late, like the shooting of Huey Newton\nOr Patrice Lumumba and Salvador Allende\nSlaughtered by the power-hungry branches of their own gente\nGhandi wasn't killed by Pakistani nationals\nHe was assassinated by a Hindu radical\nAnd Che Guevara, rebel to a U.S. continent\nWas sold to the C.I.A. by Bolivian communists\nWasn\u2019t Yitzhak Rabin murdered by a Zionist?\nAnd Anwar Sadat a victim of the same violence?\nMalcolm X was seen as a threat to the F.B.I.\nBut to blast \u2018em they used Muslims from the N.O.I.\nEven the 35th President of the Republic\nWas murdered by factions of his own government\nSo now that it\u2019s proven, that a soldier of revolution\nOr head of an empire, disguised in a constitution\nCan not escape the retribution or manipulation\nOf the self-appointed rulers of the planet's corporations\nSo I'ma need every generation to put your hands up\n\u2018Cause you can only get \u2018em off your back when you stand up\nYou might also like[Hook]\nDeep in the trenches, in the heart of a war\nThat's the place a martyr is born (Motherfucker, it's on!)\nDuring the night before the start of the dawn\nThat's the place a martyr is born (Motherfucker, it's on!)\nWhen gunshots are raining in the heart of a storm\nThat's the place a martyr is born (Motherfucker, it's on!)\nGuerilla war when the army is gone\nThat's the place a martyr is born (Motherfucker, it's on!)\n\n[Outro]\nI was a man blessed by God\nTo survive some of the worst circumstances\nI had many things: a beautiful woman I loved, a home, money\nAnd I gave it all up to bleed and to die free\nSometimes I look back on that life\nAnd I wonder what it would've been like\nAnd in moments of weakness I think about trading it\nThen I snap the fuck out of it and I get back to my reality\nAnd I realize that I'm in the heart of a war\nAnd that's the place a martyr is born7Embed"

   "lyrics": "Dominant Species Lyrics[Intro]\nYo, in a hundred years from now\nEveryone who's living on this planet will be dead\nSo it's inconsequential really, all the shit that you talk\nAll the bullshit that you stand for\nIt's more important what, what you're ready to build\nWhat you're ready to pass down to your children\nWhat you're ready to create\nYou better fuckin' remember that\nWhen you challenge a motherfucker like me\nRemember, I'm the dominant species\n[Verse 1]\nI'm stuck inside the future and life is chaotic\nThe government is psychotically racist and robotic\nThe matrix of entrapment is socio-economic\nNeurotic conspiracy theory becomes reality\nLife is war, and every day's a battle to me\nI'm on the brink of insanity\nBetween extreme intelligence and split personalities\nBut I elevate to the point of reversing gravity\nRevolutionary conceptuality spittin' out of me\nEven the dead people in my family tell me they proud of me\nStupidity's not allowed by me, \u2018cause I don't got time to play\nI'm the black hole lyricist that'll take your shine away\nDarkness at any time of day\nI'm the Technique and you're nobody so what you tryna say?\nStellar density becomes your physical alignment\n1.8 billion tons per square inch confinement\n\n[Hook]\nI drop knowledge so heavy it leaves the world unbalanced\nExterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge\nI'm the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite\nReplacing you as the dominant species on the planet\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, yo, lyrically I'm infinite, like possibilities\nBut you don't have the capability, like infertility\n\u2018Cause opening your mouth to question my validity\nIs like tryin' to contradict the theory of relativity\nWhat I spit is the epitome of heavy artillery\nMy enemies are obsessed with me, like the bitch in Misery\nBut break out, like a father runnin' from responsibility\nEvery time I step and abuse the mic with versatility\nI balance humility, with brutal instinct\nI'll make your whole cypher look like those crackers from N'Sync\nAnd I don't care about your link, or your luxury car\nI shed light with more magnitude than all of the stars\nLa Brea Tar Pit thick, so don't ever talk shit\nAnd remember somethin', nigga, while you rave and rant\nA roach can live for nine days without its head, but you can't\nYou might also like[Hook]\nI drop knowledge so heavy it leaves the world unbalanced\nExterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge\nI'm the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite\nReplacing you as the dominant species on the planet\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm explicit like video tapes of conjugal visits\nSome niggas are too stupid to understand it, like astrophysics\nTechnique is exquisite, I'll make your thoughts a victory\nGet pessimistic with the quickness\nIf you think that I will just become another statistic\nWith anything but success when I bless the mic as I spit this\nSpecifically prolific with Kaprosi\u2019s sarcoma coma type sickness\nMy style is like a ten-year-old child with a slit wrist\nToo much reality for the fuckin' hit list\nI got a Black Panther mentality with a spic fist\nSo you can get dissed, even if you're locally gold\nVocally bold, or globally, multi-platinum sold\nI'm emotionally cold, disciplined, and ready to kill\nLike spirits in the same room with you, I'm givin' you chills\nI drop knowledge while these motherfuckers clumsily spill\n\n[Hook]\nAnd I drop it so heavy, it leaves the world unbalanced\nExterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge\nI'm the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite\nReplacing you as the dominant species on the planet8Embed"

   "lyrics": "Black Vikings Lyrics[Skit from 'Planet Of The Apes']\nBeware the beast man, for he is the Devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed. Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours. Shun him; drive him back into his jungle lair, for he is the harbinger of death\n\n[Poison Pen]\nYeah! Immortal Technique! SP the Ghost! Poison Pen! Vinnie Paz!\n\nWe gonna stomp em out, run them out, run them out, call your number out, send your uncle Ruckus out\nWe gonna stomp em out, run them out, run them out, nigga ain\u2019t nothing civilized about no uncle ??? nigga, you feel me? Don\u2019t bring no uncle ??? out nigga, fuck outta here\n\n[Immortal Technique]\nAll troops in formation? Let the siege commence!\n[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]\nBack like I was locked up, putting in work\nBurning through books like Nazi's in a Catholic church\nI'm cursed like Cain when he murdered his brother\nCut your face off and wear it while I'm fucking your mother\nI'm Mars Ultor, the avenger, the god of war\nAnd if you don't believe in me, I doubt you believe in God at all\nI breathe smokeless fire, the Jinn type\nThat'll make you hate the way that Allah made you to live life\nLike Hindu, niggas that be bleaching their skin white\nOther people's teeth in my hands after a fist fight\nI was born with a sixth sense and a swift right\nSkinned werewolves and rape demons at midnight\nSell your kids into slavery after we murder you\nOr sacrifice them in the same fire we burnin' you\nBarbarian funeral, nigga, you wanna know?\nDamn the river, bury me, and let the water flow\n\n[Hook: Poison Pen]\nChaos, mayhem, bang outs, slay them, uprise, rape them, raid them\nCage em, pandemonium, insurgent, death merchants, commit the best murder\nPillage, Kill them, erase history, make them a mystery\n\n[Verse 2: Styles P]\nCut the nose off, the ears off, the whole head\nImmortal and Ghost coming, code red\nYou never seen a black barbarian\nWarrior, warlord, pussy, cut your balls off\nMore bodies come, more bodies hauled off\nWhat you want the sword and get shit sawed off\nYour throat need an axe in it\nAnd I'm breaking your back because your spine needed a crack in it\nYou bugging me, I'm coming to fumigate\nThe Wolverine, the Sabretooth, the way that I mutilate\nI'm like the viking in Valhalla Rising\nExcept I got black skin and both of my eyes in\nDon't test him, please don't stress him\nHe'll hang you from a tree with your own intestines\nHow you wanna die? Make your own suggestion\nNow talk to the lord and make your own confession\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]\nYeah, you pussies livin' in a movie theatre\nPut the motherfucking spell on you like brujeria (Brujeria!)\nChop his motherfucking head like a ruthless leader\nGuns drawn in a church service, shoot the preacher (BLRATT! BLRATT! BLRATT!)\nYou need to be godly to know Allah\nAin't no rappers eatin' 'round me, like a broken jaw\nIt ain't never been a day that I ain't broke the law\nWhatchu think I hold a motherfucking toaster for? (Carryin' the toaster!)\nI ain't goin' there, it's police in that room\nAnd Vinnie walk around with bags of dust like a vacuum\nBury you under the earth inside a black tomb\nMy body covered in Dashiki and stab wounds\nI'm a guerilla, barbarians is my ancestors\nThat's a part of my neurological transmitters\nWe Islamic and brought the story of Sham with us (Al hamdu Allah!)\nWhile we brought the motherfucking blam blam with us\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nThe walls have been breached! ANFALL!!!\nWe came in the name of peace and brotherhood, you wanted us bound in slavery, poisoned our water, changed our names...\nBurn their homes, take their jewels, skin them alive!\nHold on, hold on, hold on...\nNo one will know these people ever existed, and all that will be left is what we build upon their ruins...4Embed"

I see you standing over the grave of another dead President\n\n[Hook: Bazaar Royale]\nI see angels above me\nDemons below me\nFighting over heaven, heaven, heaven\nIt's real\n\n[Verse 1: stic.man]\nAmerica's nightmare; young, black, and just don't give a fuck\nRun up in the courtroom and wet 'em up\nGot nothin' to lose but my handcuffs\nEvery man must choose to lay down or stand up\nIt's war time, everything is fair, no fear\nWhen they say the homie murdered the judge, I don't care\nFuck 'em, he deserved it, long as the homie get away\nAnd don't get caught for the crime, I encourage it\nWe rootin' for the villain in black\nPourin' out Absolut, salute, niggas is shootin' back\nIn self-defense we bang the pistol like\nLarry Davis or Brian Nichols\nEvery pig, every public official, the boomerang\nIs coming back to get you, you reap what you sow, did you?\nThe system you created created a monster\nAnd now you scared 'cause it's coming back to haunt you\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 2: M-1]\nSince we gonna take the blame, I'mma rep my name to get my aim right\nLet's have an overthrow and after party in the same night\nSame height as Huey, same muscle build as Malcolm\nWith the same circumstances in the hood, you know the outcome\nAnd read it in the news about your sergeant and your captain\nDon't take this as a warning, just another nigga rappin'\nFuck the way we organizing, fuck the training and the grapplin'\nAnd fuck them Uncle Toms who call police because we smack them\nAnd fuck you sympathizers with your middle class reactions\n'Cause we bangin' on the system, G'd up, fuck the factions\nAnd if you didn't know, the G was for George Jackson\nAnd long live his warrior spirit packin' the Magnum\nWatching over the soldiers, knowin' niggas be blackin'\nWhen we really need to be disciplined in our ways and actions\nWhen we get some freedom you niggas can start braggin'\nTill then, inside the blood of my eye, you see the dragon\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]\nI'm like the birth of baby Mohammed, the movement I started\nCan spar with the hardest, the martyr regarded as Spartacus-hearted\nIt doesn't matter whose missiles can shoot the farthest\nWhen you're a target in an Afghan Teutoburg Forest\nClose quarters combat over corrupted elections\nBilderberg is like cancer, it grows an infection\nNepotism is the gold and the conductor's connection\nAnd ignorance is the prison that the people are kept in\nThe military ain't there for the people's protection\nThey're just there to protect an investment\nThat's why people get arrested, electrocuted, molested\nConnected streets are infested with those tired of protestin'\nTraumatized children grow to guerilla garrisons\n9/11 generations pale in comparison\nAnd you will learn a lesson repeated through history\nThat no matter what you think, occupation is not victory\nYou might also like[Outro: Immortal Technique]\nSomalia, Kashmir\nNigeria, Palestine\nIraq, bring it back\n\n[Hook x2]7Embed"

She was telling him (showing him the women in magazines who she didn\u2019t know were photoshopped) that she is never going to be as pretty as they are\u2026 particularly those who appeared to be skinny.\n\n\n\nIn this song, Tech talks about the natural beauty of woman, and how the media has a certain way of seeing if a women is beautiful. This leads to self-hatred, and women doing crazy things to make their appearance more desirable according to the media\u2019s myths\u2026 things like:\n\n\nSkin bleaching\nButt implants\nBoob implants\nNose jobs\nColloegan implants\nRelaxing hair\n\n\n\nHe also goes into how models are way, way to skinny\u2026 and if a model is fit, has some muscle, it could be considered ugly.\n\nAnother thing he touches is how black features were considered ugly, but now things like full lips and big booties are praised upon."

She was telling him (showing him the women in magazines who she didn\u2019t know were photoshopped) that she is never going to be as pretty as they are\u2026 particularly those who appeared to be skinny.\n\n\n\nIn this song, Tech talks about the natural beauty of woman, and how the media has a certain way of seeing if a women is beautiful. This leads to self-hatred, and women doing crazy things to make their appearance more desirable according to the media\u2019s myths\u2026 things like:\n\n\nSkin bleaching\nButt implants\nBoob implants\nNose jobs\nColloegan implants\nRelaxing hair\n\n\n\nHe also goes into how models are way, way to skinny\u2026 and if a model is fit, has some muscle, it could be considered ugly.\n\nAnother thing he touches is how black features were considered ugly, but now things like full lips and big booties are praised upon."

Beat Bandits, nigga!\nYeah, Harlem to Chicago to LA to Toronto\nPhilly, motherfuckin' Rio De Janeiro, nigga\nCape Town, South Africa\n\n[Verse 1]\nI never make songs to disrespect women\nOr to judge people about the way that they livin'\nBut the way I am is based on the life I was given\nLike them white boys, losin' my religion\nI used to be a Christian and a political pawn\nThe Bible is right and all your native culture is wrong\nNext thing you know you tellin' me 'bout makin' a song\nCome in the studio, and tell me that I'm makin' it wrong\nPissed off 'cause reality is makin' us strong\nLike the ghost of Timothy McVeigh makin' a bomb\nAyo, Marvin Gaye, what the fuck is goin' on?\nThese rap niggas made propaganda out of your song\nBut it's the Gong Show, amateur night at the Apollo\nMy dick is like my music but harder to swallow\nSo, children, follow me, like the Pied Piper\nAnd sing the chorus in the air, with your blunt and your lighter\nSing that shit, nigga, right now\n\n[Chorus]\nYou played yourself thinkin' you down with me\nI end your life, nigga, don't fuck around with me\nAnd if you kids can't listen, then you bound to see\nThe way you get shot for crossin' the boundary\nYou played yourself thinkin' that you down with me\nI end your life, nigga, don't fuck around with me\nAnd if you kids can't listen, then you bound to see\nThe way you get shot for crossin' the boundary\n\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe second verse is worse than the first in this respect\nScripted specifically to keep people in check\nHarlem to Boston, real niggas spit with me\nBut Landspeed, you ain't fuckin' shit to me\nAnd underground labels, know that I don't trust you\nYou only independent 'til you major, so fuck you!\nAnd if you're pissed off 'cause you think that I dissed you\nI'll rape your moms and we can make this a personal issue\nDance with the Devil, remember that you're not on my level\nStupid, you're not ready\nI won Disypher, Bragging Rights from Rocksteady\nAnd practically every battle that they got in New York\nAnd I'll still murder rappers on the street for sport\nDoctor Guillotine cuttin' you short, little man\nBut you don't give me props, 'cause I never won at Scribble Jam\nWell, fuck you! I hope someone you love dies\nSo fuck your crew! And fuck your family too!\nTechnique said it, bitch, what the fuck you gon' do?\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nYou played yourself thinkin' you down with me\nI end your life, nigga, don't fuck around with me\nAnd if you kids can't listen, then you bound to see\nThe way you get shot for crossin' the boundary\nYou played yourself thinkin' that you down with me\nI end your life, nigga, don't fuck around with me\nAnd if you kids can't listen, then you bound to see\nThe way you get shot for crossin' the boundary\n\n[Interlude]\nYeah, wrap it up on these niggas, man!\nWrap it up, yeah!\n\n[Verse 3]\nImmortal Technique incinerate degenerate fags\nBurn Trent Lott wrapped in his Confederate flag\nI got the Beretta with my face wrapped in a rag\nSo put the African slave jewelry in the bag\nMotherfuckers tell me that a diamond is forever\nBut is it worth the blood of Malcolm and Medgar Evers?\nHouse niggas, get your head severed, tryna be thug\nYou don't concern me, I'm tryin' to hurt the people you love\nWord of mouth is I'm in the club, bein' sneaky\nI'm like the body snatchers, and your girl is gettin' sleepy\nI murder you indiscreetly, right at the source\nLike the Roman legionnaire that stabbed Christ on the cross\nThis is about you, though, it ain't about Jesus\nAnd you shouldn't fuckin' talk about telekenesis\nNigga, please, movin' shit with your mind\nTry movin' your moms out the projects with your rhymes\nAnd next time, I'm comin' after cualquiera\nProfanity, fuckin' carajo maldita mierda!\nRoll up the hierba, y pasala, para la izquierda\nPut the price up to listen to me pop shit\n'Cause I got Martha Stewart givin' me stock tips\nUnderground money with honeys up in the whip\nBangbus.com, nigga, fuckin' your bitch\n[Outro]\nYeah, played yourself, nigga, fuck all y'all!\nYou don't know shit about me\nWhy open your mouth and discuss who the fuck I am?\nI thought I told y'all niggas on Volume 1\nI wasn't fuckin' around, you just slept\n'Cause you sold a few thousand units in the golden era\nWhen niggas would buy anything on the shelf\nThose days are through, and you are through with them3Embed"

(Yeah right)\nYou ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' racist bitch\nFull of hatred, pressin' a button tryin' to eject me (Hahaha)\nBut I ain't got no motherfuckin' deal with Pepsi\nNo corporate sponsor tellin' me what to do\nAskin' me to tone it down during the interview (Never!)\nTryin' to minimize the issue but I'm keepin' it large\nI love the place I live but I hate the people in charge\nSpeakin' is hard when you got strings attached\nSo I'ma say it for you 'cause I don't got none of that\nAnd if you didn't understand what I spit at your brain\nAyo son, let this little nigga explain\nYou might also like[Chorus: Pinocchio sample]\nI got no strings, so I have fun\nI'm not tied up to anyone\nThey\u2019ve got strings, but you can see\nThere are no strings on me\n\n[Verse 3]\nCome on, son, y'all niggas know the way I do\nImmortal Technique dot com live for you\nAnd I know sometimes it be makin' you nervous\nThe way I snatch puppet rappers that belong in a circus\nYou motherfuckers just can't compare\nLookin' for a fanbase that's no longer there\nI know that you're scared and you're hidin' up in the cut\nBut this is freedom of speech, nigga, tell 'em what's up\n\n[Outro]\nWord, nigga! Fuck John Ashcroft!\nNigga, fuck Fox News!

In the first verse, he comes down hard on promiscuous se\u00f1oritas who don\u2019t respect themselves or anyone around them. In the second, he calls out fake gangsters who front like they\u2019re tough. He calls himself a resurrected Che Guevara, comparing the fake men to Tony Montana."

Look out)\nAnd then I'm positive at Showtime\nI make negative MC's switch styles in no time\nThey change teams, rhyme about kings and queens\nInstead of how they sellin' work to fiends\nThen I switch thugs into soldiers\nThose that have given up on God to praise Jay-Hova (Damn!)\nThe rap Ice Age is over\nAnd positivity protects the Z boulder boulder\n[Interlude: Immortal Technique]\nYeah, you know how it goes\nPositivity, yeah\n\n[Hook: Immortal Technique & Big Zoo]\nMy opinion is solid ground but you're a common hater\nSplittin' and dividin' on numbers like a denominator\nThird-eye navigator movements are necessary\nEverything you see in videos is secondary\nYou need positivity like you need respect in jail\nBecause without balance you'll be makin' negative record sales\nNeg-neg-negative record sales\nZiga-zam, Technique, like this\n\n[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\nI jerk off inside books and give life to words\nLeavin' concepts stuck together you probably never heard\nI love when people think I'm psychologically disturbed\n'Cause it means I overloaded their neurological nerves\nRappers try to serve me with disgusting incompetence\nBut I keep it positive with ultimate dominance\nMeditatin' with Native Americans close to Providence\nI speak to the spirits of ancestors at pow-wows\nBut rumor has it that you gettin' raped like Lil' Bow Wow\nNow listen, industry motherfuckers, don't get offended\nRemember that I'll bring an end to your pretender agenda\nAnd render contenders dismembered\nBend the fabric of time and put your soul in a blender\nYou livin' a lie like thinkin' Jesus was born in December\nInstead of caterin' to labels, somethin' gotta give\nI'll rip the electrons out your body and make you positive\nI seen a lot of kids come and go with marketing gimmicks\nBecause without balance, you don't last more than a minute\nThis ain't a game, I'll beat the shit out you at the line of scrimmage\nI rock shows in the ghetto, nigga, you stuck in the village\nI wanted to spit on the radio since I was eleven\nBut I can't afford the pay-ola for Hot 97\nSo I make paper underground, and I'm soon to blow\nMovin' tapes like Biggie's ghost at Bad Boy studios\n*Biggie \u2013 \"Hypnotize\" sample*\nYou might also like[Hook: Immortal Technique & Big Zoo]\nMy opinion is solid ground but you're a common hater\nSplittin' and dividin' on numbers like a denominator\nThird-eye navigator movements are necessary\nEverything you see in videos is secondary\nYou need positivity like you need respect in jail\nBecause without balance you'll be makin' negative record sales\nNeg-neg-negative record sales\nZiga-zam, Technique, like this2Embed"

   "lyrics": "Sign Of The Times Lyrics[Intro: traditional Lakota Sioux song]\n\n[Verse 1]\nImagine the Word of God without religious groupies\nImagine a savior born in a Mexican hooptie\nPersecuted single mother in a modern manger\nYou'd crucify him again like a fuckin' stranger\nTears of the anger are worth more than diamonds or rubies\nImagine bein' locked up since juvie\nImagine changin' your life and still goin' out like Tookie\nImagine niggas talkin' shit when they never knew me\nImagine a movie that depicted the pain in your life\nLike them kids in Afghanistan chasin' a kite\nFor most of the world, that's what it's like\nImagine if the woman you suppose to love for the rest of your life\nIs set to marry someone else at the end of the night\nThey say you fight the greatest jihad in your heart and your mind\nAnd fight the hardest when you start from behind\nSo I dream the impossible all the time\nFuck a Masonic design \u2014 America's future is mine\nRepeat that to yourself, 'cause if culture's a crime\nThem numbers tatted on your arm aren't too far behind\nThey can only conquer you after they've murdered your mind\nSo rise up, motherfucker, like the sign of the times\nI feel my body weakenin', but my spirit is fine\nReady to go to war with devils at the drop of a dime\nAnd fight with my rebel army until the stars are aligned\n[Break: Lakota]\n\n[Verse 2]\nNostradamus was a white man's prophet\nWho predicated European supremacist logic\nBecause the pilgrims and Conquistador columns\nKilled more innocent people than Hitler and Stalin\nI guess the fortune-tellers skipped an antichrist or two\nBrother, give this to the OG's doin' life with you\nAnd pray for the problems with the Pope psychology\nSo the Vatican will offer an apology (for what?)\nFor destroyin' the people's liberation theology\nSnatchin' the spirit of Jesus from people in poverty\nBusiness decisions like keepin' people in prisons\nBut had the opposite effect: incarceratin' religion\nThat type of crooked politics imposed on a populous\nIs obvious if you read the Northwood documents\nForget the compliments for what I recorded\nAnd live for revolution instead of always dyin' for it\nRemember a bullet can never stop me\nMy legions are led by the spirit Haile Selassie, watch me\nEven if I'm shot in the chakra, I will prosper\nDoppler effect, bumpin' music out a helicopter\nTellin' the Persians, \"Dig up Zoroaster!\"\nAnd tell them I came back as the son of the Ahura Mazda\nFish out the Philistine Dagon from the shores of Gaza\nAnd call Quetzalcoatl flyin' over La Raza\nThis is my message to the older gods\nI'll sacrifice you all to the revolution, like the Romanovs\nLost in the desert like the Hebrews of Israel\nThe blood clot system tried to kill me like sickle-cell\nBut I survived, and I'm alive to fight another day\nCocooned in a coma, I can still hear my mother pray\nSister cryin' out to God, \"Please let my brother stay!\"\nWalkin' towards the light, but somethin' is pullin' me the other way\nYou might also like[Outro: Cornel West]\nImmortal Technique\nRise up, young brother!\nIt is not your time to die4Embed"

What the fuck do you do?\n\n[Verse]\nI calculate planet alignment like Mayan astronomy\nDiscoverin' atrocities\nWorse than Aristotle subjectin' children to sodomy\nYour theory of the galaxy is primitive like Ptolemy\nThe truth about the universe dug up like Aztec pottery\nUnpredictable results like experimental psychology\nI stomp the streets with emcee's beneath my feet in colonies\nBut presentation and spirit revolve around autonomy\nSearchin' for monogamy\nAnd cuttin' fake bitches out of my mind like a lobotomy\nSo obviously I'm not gonna be here to play games\nWalk the top of the world and leave the arctic circle in flames\nBattle the beast and false prophet predicted in the King James\nI give a fuck about your emcee name, I don't admire you\nOnly by dental records will you be identifiable\n'Cause the future is not reliable\nRemember when rap was not economically viable?\nComparable to what motherfuckers think of me\nI might be nobody, but wait 'til I'm together like a symphony\nResoundin' sound that will continue infinitely\nAngel of Death punishin' all those who live in infamy\nAnd shine so far away from you\nYou'll never get a glimpse of me\nAttempts to extinguish me don't even bother me none\nLike retarded kids throwin' ice cubes at the sun\nA victory against Immortal Technique will never be done\nJust degrees of losin' it every second you're addin' one\nSome niggas dream of pushin' kilos, but I drop tons\nWith more facts and formulas and philosophical logic\nThen a basement full of scientists puffin' on chronic\nDip the mic in potassium cyanide and liquid bubonic\nAnd use it as a sonic wand to find the spawn of the demonic\nScreamin' like Onyx is of absolutely no consequence\nThe poison is dense enough to clog up your arteries\nMercy is not a part of me\nI cause you bodily injury permanently\nBecause simply verbally murdering me\nIs inconceivable 'cause of the unbelievable evil injected inside\nThe blood stream of my people\nAnd redemption is not located under a church steeple\nThe feeble and the meek in soul just like the technique\nWill inherit the Earth, but the Earth will be weak\nMother Earth in her decrepit terminal illness physique\nThe year 3000 is bleak, no happily ever after\nJust death following the Fourth Reich disaster\nA legacy of bastards, with plastic explosives\nYour future's been eroded, 'cause you forgot that when your free it's multiplied indefinitely\nBy the struggle that be, the struggle I see\nTo socialistically unite the Third World countries\nExpose hypocrisy in America's democracy\nSloppily obsessed with stoppin' me 'cause I speak prophecy\nTrample and dismantle your capitalist philosophy\nThe same way I stomp the conquerin' rap monopoly\nAnd I'm not a fuckin' prophet\u2026 but that's the fuckin' prophecyYou might also like10Embed"

    "plain": "This track is listed #11 and was featured on The 3rd World, Tech\u2019s fourth studio album, on the 24th of June, 2008.\n\nImmortal Technique quite rightly says that the developed world looks down on the third world as being \u2018backward\u2019 because economic aristocracies argue that they lack freedom of speech. However, if we view the music industry in the developed world, the concept of artists being signed to the major labels is extremely hypocritical- especially in \u2018the land of the free\u2019. Why? Because whatever comes out of the artist\u2019s mouth is restricted and manipulated. As an artist you are owned by those major labels, which are corporations run by people who simply view the artist as an asset, the music as a product and us, as mere consumers. Therefore the major labels' central aim is PROFIT. To me, if profit is the goal of corporations of the music industry, they are in complete contradiction to hip-hop. Let us not forget that hip-hop came into existence because it was the only mechanism for an oppressed coloured man to hold a mic and say whatever he wanted. Hip-hop was the platform for free speech- essentially it was the voice of the voiceless. Besides just being \u2018party music\u2019, the music and the lyrics held a spiritual and intellectual weight. It gave the people an opportunity to speak about what they thought could be possible. Thus hip-hop encouraged the achievement of values derivable from life, it recognised independence, individuality and most importantly- it had the people\u2019s interest at heart. This is the true soul of hip-hop. However, as soon as a corporation\u2019s executive is the one defining the rules on that oval table in the office, the music is no longer real and meaningful. The aim of hip-hop music has shifted from caring about people, to profit maximisation. This has disrupted the very foundations of hip-hop and is exactly why we currently see a lot of empty music being produced. Corporations will not invest in artists who have something meaningful or true to say, mainly because they will not be profitable from a sales point of view since they only cater to the needs of the deceived mass market. Even marketing strategies have catalysed an incorrect perception of what hip-hop is. Many artists become so blinded by the flashing lights and profitability that they become oblivious to the fact that to be a hip-hop artist, a level of responsibility exists to preserve and build on the foundations of hip-hop. The instant an artist becomes commercialised, their music, their lyrics and even they themselves, become compromised. I am in no way implying that all artists who are signed to the majors have lost the true meaning of hip-hop. No doubt a few great artists exist, but they have been in the game for a very long time. These are the artists who realise the significance of the very origins of hip-hop and are not motivated by making a dollar. Their music and objectives are parallel to the true soul and culture of hip-hop. It is very rare for a new emerging artist in the commercial music industry to hold those same values. I believe that there is definitely a great deal of potential currently out there, but it is outweighed by the strength of corporations to mould hip-hop potential into meaningless money-making crap. Indeed, making money is the objective of every artist (including independent artists) and I would be lying if I said otherwise. But there is a big difference between an aim and an objective. The central aim of a true hip-hop artist, is to entertain and educate the people. Multiple layers within entertainment exist. It can inspire people, it can alter perceptions and it can make people relate to something they are going through in their lives. But entertainment can also deceive, delude and \u2018dumb down\u2019 people- corporations have taken full advantage of the latter.\n\n\u2018Open your eyes\u2019 reflects the two-fold meaning of The 3rd World album. While corporations are enjoying increasing sales, the profits generated supports imperialism. Why would corporations prevent artists to speak about things like government cover-ups, the demolition of towers and the illegal occupation of Palestine (despite the fact that hip-hop\u2019s foundations was strongly Islamically influenced from the onset)? It is because these censored things fuel their existence. It is the same money, along with our tax, that pays for illegal wars, robbing third world countries of their resources and taking advantage of cheap labour which adds to the uneven distribution of wealth and prevents the poor countries from economically advancing. This concept of taking advantage of the third world also occurs in the rap industry, whereby the underground can be viewed as \u2018the 3rd world\u2019 and artists are exploited for monetary gains."

I am in no way implying that all artists who are signed to the majors have lost the true meaning of hip-hop. No doubt a few great artists exist, but they have been in the game for a very long time. These are the artists who realise the significance of the very origins of hip-hop and are not motivated by making a dollar. Their music and objectives are parallel to the true soul and culture of hip-hop. It is very rare for a new emerging artist in the commercial music industry to hold those same values. I believe that there is definitely a great deal of potential currently out there, but it is outweighed by the strength of corporations to mould hip-hop potential into meaningless money-making crap. Indeed, making money is the objective of every artist (including independent artists) and I would be lying if I said otherwise. But there is a big difference between an aim and an objective. The central aim of a true hip-hop artist, is to entertain and educate the people. Multiple layers within entertainment exist. It can inspire people, it can alter perceptions and it can make people relate to something they are going through in their lives. But entertainment can also deceive, delude and \u2018dumb down\u2019 people- corporations have taken full advantage of the latter.\n\n\u2018Open your eyes\u2019 reflects the two-fold meaning of The 3rd World album. While corporations are enjoying increasing sales, the profits generated supports imperialism. Why would corporations prevent artists to speak about things like government cover-ups, the demolition of towers and the illegal occupation of Palestine (despite the fact that hip-hop\u2019s foundations was strongly Islamically influenced from the onset)? It is because these censored things fuel their existence. It is the same money, along with our tax, that pays for illegal wars, robbing third world countries of their resources and taking advantage of cheap labour which adds to the uneven distribution of wealth and prevents the poor countries from economically advancing. This concept of taking advantage of the third world also occurs in the rap industry, whereby the underground can be viewed as \u2018the 3rd world\u2019 and artists are exploited for monetary gains."

   "lyrics": "Open Your Eyes LyricsWe're here because of you\nWe're here because you were there\n\nWe've arrived from every corner of the planet to this nation to seek the fulfillment of a promise of America. We were promised a better life in our home countries, where we were told that privatizing water and electricity will make things run more efficiently. Instead the quality remained almost the same and the price was increased until it became an unaffordable luxury. Some corporations are more efficient than government, but their motivation is not the health or the well-being of the people; it's only about profit. Everything else\u2014their image, their human resources, their public relations\u2014only exist to protect the reality behind it. Once upon a time we were told that nationalization would prevent growth by limiting competition, that our countries were nothing without the companies that invested in us, and so they privatized everything. Everything in our country was owned by people that had no connection to our culture, by those who never had our interests at heart. They didn't care about our survival or well-being\u2014they just wanted to turn a profit by raping our land, by exploiting our people, our industry and our resources. They took everything we built and made it theirs, first by creating racism to justify slavery, building the capital for capitalism, and then when they gave us what they call liberty, everything we had was still owned by them. Our governments told us that socialism was the real enemy, and that we would have freedom, but the foreign powers and corporations were the ones with real freedom, the freedom to take all the wealth generated by our work and our land and gave us only a small percentage of the scraps from the table. Their lust for power and their greed drove them to betray not only us but themselves and the word of their own God\n\n(Open your eyes before you die)\n\nAnd while some used missionaries and donations to off-set this abuse, other countries and companies were blatant with their crimes, using war, disease, and sanctions that killed millions. They supported corrupt governments that were almost like the old slave masters in their oppression of the people, because their loyalty was to those who enabled them, and stored them and kept them in power. They became the bastard children of American industry, kleptocracy, governments of thievery. They protected the corporations and went to war against their own people to preserve those profits. The puppet rulers were given billions of US tax dollars to fund civil wars, right wing death squads, execute political dissidents, sympathetic clergy, and even overthrow democratically elected governments. And so the age of revolution began again. They painted it as godless terrorist versus the free world and the free market. But the free market has never been free, because the market does not regulate itself. It is manipulated like a puppet, and it survives because of its image. Destroy the image, and the enemy will die. Such is the same in the rap industry. But the major label super powers treat the underground like the Third World. When they need new assets, new artists to prostitute a side-ins, and put on a shelf to use their songs; when they needed new concepts, music and publishing to steal from the producers, they came to the underground, to the Third World. They took our culture, our property and our industry and our resources, even using our own people to help them exploit us. But behind the mask of efficiency, they claimed that we need them to succeed. They're no better than us. Their economic advertising was always a lie. A few got rich, but most were given an illusion of wealth, almost as if it was designed for failure. Opportunity comes at the price of the soul in the music, so remember what they are underneath the fancy architecture, glittering rented jewelry, the cars, the IMF loans, the seeds with suicide genes, 20-year contracts, and oil blood money. Build your defenses, my independent brothers and sisters. They\u2019ll stop at nothing to get what they want. They paint the Third World underground as savage and backward. But the super powers are no less corrupt; they've just learned to disguise it better, \u2018cause they fix elections too, they embezzle tax money, they go to war for resources, they fund terrorism for their own benefit. And when there's enough at stake, history's taught us that they'll even assassinate their own presidents\n\n(WAKE UP!)\n[Ronald Reagan recording]\nJust as the Columbia represents man's highest aspirations in the field of science, so too does the struggle of the Afghan people represent man's highest aspiration for freedom, and I am dedicating on behalf of the American people the March 22nd launch of the Columbia Space Shuttle to the people of AfghanistanYou might also like4Embed"

Your mother?\nIt wasn't a gang, we were just a group of friends.\n\u2014 Did you do bad things?\n\u2014 No no no, look, we just used to draw on stuff, play karate, borrow things, throw stuff, you know, run around at night, like Goonies.\n\u2014 What's a Goonie?\n\u2014 You never heard of Goonies before?!\n[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]\nI could've chose another life with the feds tryna get me\nLittle kids puttin' work in like at Gap and Disney\nIn the whip, high as shit like Bobby and Whitney\nGrab your hand and push the motherfuckin' pedal to sixty\nHarlem cops frisk me to get me to make their quotas\nBut I told ya \"Siempre hay que separar las drogas\"\nBar brawl in the club, poppin' and rockin' jaws\nShot it out, leavin' bullet holes the size of Matzoh balls\nI love thick chicks, never fucked with a slim broad\nPlayed soccer and hammered nails into their shin guards\nGambled at cee lo with Dominicans locked in the tombs\nWe was there for robbin' niggas for them Spanish doubloons\nRemember Goonie-era graffiti of all sorts?\nNow they wanna foreclose on the hood to build a golf course\nI'll put your hand in a blender to make an entr\u00e9e\nThen cut your dick off and glue it back on the wrong way\n\n[Hook: Immortal Technique]\nAll my revolutionary soldiers better ride\nMy word is mathematics, bitch, numbers never lie\nSo even if they tell you I'm dead, I'm still alive\nBecause, motherfucker, Goonies never die\nWitness protection program, rappers better hide\nI serve revenge out the freezer, niggas never slide\nSo if they tell you I'm gone and you safe, niggas lied\nBecause, motherfucker, Goonies never die\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Swave Sevah]\nI'm a certified Goonie, the type to burglarize your crib\nAnd leave it smellin' like sour and Afghan gooey\nLife is a movie, but yours was filmed on a greener screen\nI give you pure uncut raw, no deleted scenes\nWar with a broadsword, dumpin' a TEC-9\nSlit your throat, give you a Colombian necktie\nThe best buy to get, we let die\nLet fly the next guy to try some shit\nListen, a few words just to describe my clique\nWe like a gang of Spartans, walkin' on the Gaza Strip\nNever say die it's time to fight and we never run\nMy Goonies rob niggas for jewelry\nWe call 'em treasure hunts\nLet him front like he a tough guy with me\nI'll hit him, slug turn him to One-Eyed Willy\nWatery grave, hide your chips\nI'll hijack your boat load and cruise away on my pirate ship\n\n[Hook: Immortal Technique]\nAll my revolutionary soldiers better ride\nMy word is mathematics, bitch, numbers never lie\nSo even if they tell you I'm dead, I'm still alive\nBecause, motherfucker, Goonies never die\nWitness protection program, rappers better hide\nI serve revenge out the freezer, niggas never slide\nSo if they tell you I'm gone and you safe, niggas lied\nBecause, motherfucker, Goonies never die\n[Verse 3: Diabolic]\nBefore Duncan Pinderhughes was runnin' with Doug E. Doug\nMy team got away with murder, we ain't fit the bloody glove\nThose jungle breeds and we come to feed our hungry cubs\nWith hoes pullin' out our pipes\nLike Goonies under country clubs\nLet these funny thugs know whoever steps in Bolic's spot\nIs gettin' crushed with solid rock like Chester Copperpot\nI suggest the drama stops, I'll flood blocks with mustard gas\nYou're up shits creek in a rubber raft cut in half\nCross my fuckin' path, I dare you, I'll mangle who lit the fuse\nQuick to lose my marbles like Mikey replacin' his with jewels\nWatchin' y'all enslave the game, I'm forced to say the truth\nBreak the chains quick as Sloth reachin' for a Baby Ruth\nWe got 80 proof and whores in Daisy Dukes extra low\nWhile fat bitches do the truffle shuffle just to get in shows\nFuck what your record sold! Respect the code and recognize\nThe rebel tribe that my people kept alive will never die\n\n[Hook: Immortal Technique]\nAll my revolutionary soldiers better ride\nMy word is mathematics, bitch, numbers never lie\nSo even if they tell you I'm dead, I'm still alive\nBecause, motherfucker, Goonies never die\nWitness protection program, rappers better hide\nI serve revenge out the freezer, niggas never slide\nSo if they tell you I'm gone and you safe, niggas lied\nBecause, motherfucker, Goonies never die5Embed"

(Definitely)\nYou cannot second guess yourself in these days and times\nThey're gonna throw whatever they can at you and you gotta\nBe prepared for it, you gotta be prepared for anything\n[Malcolm X]\n\"It's liberty or it's death\nIt's freedom for everybody or it's freedom for nobody!\"\n\n(Hook)\nNo matter what the fuck life throws at me\nI continue to make it through indefinitely\nImmortal Technique defeats the odds repetitively\nUntil there ain't shit ahead of me competitively\nSurviving the tough times is imperative to me\nLooking at the whole world revolutionarily\n\n[Malcolm X]\nThey don\u2019t want to hear you old Uncle Tom\nHandkerchief heads talking about the odds\n\nTechnique will force you into strategical retreat\nBecause I dominate guerrilla warfare in the streets\nThere ain't no way to picture me without a victory speech\nWhen I reach higher positions\nWithout the recognition of pissed on competition\nCause I conquered their renditions\nIn a systematic form like a religious tradition\nMy mission is to take you, lyrically break you\nLyrically assassinate you\nLyrically incinerate your body and recreate you\nTo destroy the power that mentally incarcerates you\nCause even though I rip it better I could not forsake you\nYou're my people with the same oppressors so how could I hate you\nThe revolution of the mind that bring me generates you\nBut when you come original people impersonate you, start to hate you\nCause the conflict is building within the ultimate sin\nIs to be ashamed of your skin\nMy rhymes are like Jamaican over proof I make the room spin\nIntoxicated flow I bleed vodka and brandy\nDon't make me choke you down like Jon Ben\u00e9t Ramsey\nSomething demands of me to rip this fucking shit uncannily\nGod commanded me to be a technological disease\nAnd psychologically do battle with the best emcee's\nUpper-case the 'T' in Technique\nCause I'm the capital of revolutionary nation that's infallible\nAztec; Lecter, Hannibal\nRip your heart out of your chest and feed it to the cannibals\nYour just a fucking animal but I'm the Neosapien\nCause my original civilization was based upon creation\nYou know theirs no escaping even though your heart is racing\nI'll put your best disciple on academic probation\nFuck the litigation, fuck the best rapper nominations\nAnd fuck the president I voted for assassination\nI'm saying fuck the federal bullshit investigations\nFuck the cover up of ghetto radiation extermination\nUsing my people for experimentation\nAnd if doesn't play hip hop then fuck your radio station\nYou might also like(Hook)\nNo matter what the fuck life throws at me\nI continue to make it through indefinitely\nImmortal Technique defeats the odds repetitively\nUntil there ain't shit ahead of me competitively\nSurviving the tough times is imperative to me\nLooking at the whole world revolutionarily\n\n[Malcolm X]\nRevolutions overturn systems, revolutions destroy systems! (crowd cheers)\n\nYo what the fuck happen to reality spitting rhyme slayers\nThese days everybody trying to be a thug or a player\nWhere did all the real motherfuckers go in the game\nBring back the break dancers and graffiti writers with fame\nI remember hip hop before the mic gun clapping\nCause I used to drink forties with more flavor then these rappers\nLyrical ego trips doesn't make fortification\nYour not dope enough, spit self glorification\nSo don't jerk me around cause my name ain't masturbation\nLife is hard it'll leave you scarred cause I been through shit\nIf you consider rap a job I suggest that you quit\nDon't you understand the audience will listen and dance\nIn the club, crib or car or whatever they get the chance\nTo be emancipated start debating justice in the cipher\nWhy do you think project rooms look like the cells in Rikers\nI'm explaining the significance on the reason behind it\nThey're preparing your children for the prison environment\nWhen you don't amount to shit prison becomes retirement\nBut I refuse to be took in to central booking in chains\nCause sleeping on the floor in cages starts to fuck with your brain\nThe system ain't reformatory, it's only purgatory\nClose to hell but I rebel as begin to spark an L\nAnd tell my people how we fell into the trap that we live in\nBecause they locked us up in ghetto's and began to rape our women\nSo I leave the system Unforgiven like Eastwood\nCause I was bless with lyrical strength to do whatever I could\nYou should of seen it coming long ago when you were very young\nMy word is through the father, holy spirit and his fucking son\nCause when I grab the mic device in front of Christ and start to rip it\nI'll make Jesus turn around and say \"yo pop this nigga flipped it\"\nSo talk about whatever and be what you wanna be\nBut don't mistake the way I break the faith for simple blasphemy\nCause through the highest frequencies in the NYC\nI'm crushing 97.1 percent of MC's\n(Hook)\nNo matter what the fuck life throws at me\nI continue to make it through indefinitely\nImmortal Technique defeats the odds repetitively\nUntil there ain't shit ahead of me competitively\nSurviving the tough times is imperative to me\nLooking at the whole world revolutionarily5Embed"

Same as a crash flight that took off when the music died on your last night\nTell 'em the truth and they call you a traitor\nTalk to 'em honestly and they call you a hater\nLosing my composure cause the message is urgent\nTalking reckless, drunk on the mic, like Larry Merchant\nCursing at the serpent Sumerian demons\nWho brush their wings against the air that I'm breathin'\nA heathen with nothing left to believe in. Even a reason from living that was forgiven by God and not religion\nEnvision Jesus risen from the dead like Horus\nIn the baptist church shaking off the rigor mortis\nThe borders should be illegal instead of the people\nThat were here before the Bible and all of its sequels\nI speak to the detached and unrealistic\nThat were born normal but turned socially autistic\nWe resisted homeland securities mission\nBecause I know what they really envisioned\n[Hook x2]You might also like6Embed"

We are a colony, we are fighting for freedom\nBecause we will not be a slave nation por favor\nThe struggle here is to make universities\nThe struggle here is in the community\nIt's against the police and violence\nIt's against discrimination\nIt's against the crime against humanity on this beautiful Caribbean Island. This is Panama\nYoung lords, revolutionary always, from San Juan, Puerto Rico\nQue viva Puerto Rico libre!6Embed"

Where your diamonds at?\"\nStupid\n[Chours: Mojo and Immortal Technique]\nCan't dodge the game\nIf you lookin' for the money or the fame (oh-ohh)\nThe players and the rules ain't changed (oh no)\nBut see we tryin' to leave a name\nSo we're turnin' out\nYeah, this is how pimps get pimped and players get played\nRich people get robbed and, broke niggas paid\nNew York, London, Chicago, Philly and L.A\nMiami, D.C., B-more and out in the Bay\nWe're tearin it out of the frame\nSee we deserve to stake that claim\nIf we didn't it's a cryin shame\nWhat we're concerned about is how to turn it out\n\n[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\nShow me a pretty girl, with the world stuck to her\nAnd I bet you there's a brother that's tired of fuckin her\nLots of niggas girls is someone else's one night stand\nI probably made some bitches nervous listenin with they man (ha ha)\nAnd if that offends somebody, I'm sorry, fuck you!\nWhat you think, revolutionaries don't like to fuck too?\nYou just gotta beware of dangerous coochie\nCover ya head like a kufi, some rappers think that they live in a movie\nUntil they get herpes or clap from a groupie\nAnd I don't need to shout you out, nigga you know who you be\nLook, most people are only players cause they got played\nAnd have not, let go of that, shit since the 7th grade\nYeah you got your heart broke, life sucks, doesn't it?\nBut you shouldn't fuck up someone else's life because of it\nSomeone did your mother like that, that's why you fatherless\nBefore jail or racist cops, that's what the problem is\nYou might also like[Chours 2: Mojo and Immortal Technique]\nSee who's the one to place that blame\nWe getting trapped in cycle of pain\nWith a generation headed down the drain\nThat's how we're turning out\nThis is how pimps get pimped\nAnd players get played\nBeautiful women get cheated on\nAnd gangsters strayed\nJersey, Detroit, Denver, Phoenix, Atlanta\nTexas, Vegas, Seattle and fuckin Louisiana\nRegardless of the money you're paid\nYou spend it on a watch and a chain\nBut can't offer your children a thing\nWhat the hell is goin' on in your brain?\n\n[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]\nYeah, I'm not a crack rapper, I'm not a backpacker (ha ha ha)\nI'm not a wack rapper, moonlighting as a bad actor\nI treat labels like the projects, cause I'm a hater (what!)\nGo to the Sony building and piss in the elevator\nCater to hustlers, crooks and cheap smugglers\nBootleg my own album, to reach customers (yeah)\nEvery city, state and country, the hood love me\nEven Aborigines, in Australia bump me\nThey say underground fans are all the color of talcum\nBut who the fuck you think buy 50 and Jay albums?\nWho the fuck you think made Snoop and Dre platinum?\nCall up any major record label and ask 'em\nBut there's some, devils in disguise in hip-hop\nThat belong at Republican fundraisers with Kid Rock (bitch!)\nI hope one of my fans has one of your kids shot (bitch!)\nAnd blames it on Acid, Prozac and Slipknot\nYou a pussy actin hard like a bitch cop\nI'll drop you to the floor like a reverse wristlock\nEat your food and shit on you, like a highway pit stop\nAnd make, revolutionaries out of kids that used to flip rocks\nThe government, pimped 9/11 to go to Iraq\nAnd history, repeats itself right on track (how?)\nFirst as a tragedy, and then the comedy begins (why?)\nCause it's funny, motherfuckers don't see it come around again\n[Outro: Mojo and (Immortal Technique)]\nWhere, can we be free? (FUCK we gon' be free man?)\nWe only wanna live our lives\nLive our lives, with our eyes open\nOpen your eyes open your eyes\nYou stupid motherfuckers - you stupid motherfuckers\nOpen your eyes, before you die4Embed"

   "lyrics": "\u00daltimas Palabras LyricsA new American revolution has begun. Not against the forces of a colonial kingdom, but a rebellion against an oppressor that has risen among us\nIt is not a foreign invasion we have to fear, rather the threat of a force within our nation that has usurped what was once a dream of having the greatest democracy ever known to man\n\nWe now live in a world where the population has grown exponentially\nAnd the planet is running out of resources to sustain us all. We in the inner-city and those struggling in the suburban ghettos may not realize it yet, but make no mistake, the people who control the technology and run every enterprise that makes up our world have seen this coming for a long time. The ideas of renewable energy, global warming, the idea of collectively working were purposefully bought out, derailed, demonized, or corrupted in favor of an economic structure designed by a monetary caste system\n\nIn a desperate attempt to convince us that we need to maintain that extravagant existence, they\u2019ve pretended we might share in their dream\nThat we can justify any inhumanity in its name. Out of this blind ignorance was born the curse of slavery. Many of the founders of this nation were themselves Masons. That is not a Left wing or Right wing conspiracy theory. It is a widely known and accepted fact\n\nSo then explain to me how a nation founded by men who not only understood the long and complicated history of Europe, but also that of Africa could permeate such a lie in convincing the American public that one race of men was superior and one inferior. When, in fact, we know that all the early men the people who created civilization and every aspect of what we see today, the foundation of all modern human life, were from Africa\nThe greatest cowardice of course came not with slavery itself, unfortunately. But with the excuses for slavery. For if America had been as brave as the Roman Empire and all other empires that have come after her, and claimed \u201cNo, we were just stronger and that\u2019s why we took you,\u201d then when slavery was over, racism would\u2019ve probably followed in suit\n\nBut instead it was the social lie, the religious lie that was told that stayed in the minds of people that separated one human being from another. In order to distract us from the issues of class and freedom, they created issues around religion and race to dominate the world for centuries to come\n\nSome claim that they respect the culture of life in this country. They cry out for indignity of children that are slaughtered before they are born. But God has not penetrated their souls, for they have no empathy. Nothing in their cold hearts for the hundreds of thousands of lives we have taken in our wars overseas, for that which they call \u201ccollateral damage,\u201d which are the burnt and damaged children of the world. They have no prayers for them. Only snide commentary on the internet and laughter in their hearts. And yet you claim to be one with God?\n\nWe talk about immigration in this country. Might doesn\u2019t make right, ladies and gentleman; it just makes right now. What we are saying to the rest of the world is, one day, when America grows weak, one day when her legions falter, on the day when her economy crumbles... China, Russia, Europe, whatever power has arisen... all you have to do is come here and conquer us in a few military excursions, and then you too can set up shop here, and in 100 years you can tell every red-blooded American, \u201cNo, you are an illegal human being. I am the true citizen. I have all the rights. You have no rights.\"\n\nMaybe you forgot how you got this country. Maybe you take for granted the blood, the sweat, the tears, that the people who live in practical serfdom shed everyday. For we may not run America, but we make America run\n\nWe talk about the Law, yet how many indignities have been legal in the past? How many treaties with Native American people have we broken? How many international laws have we violated? And, speaking of laws how can a corporation be regulated by a government that is funded and controlled by corporations? How can there be accountability for people who see a profit margin above the lives of Americans? Above the lives of human beings in other countries?\n\nWe have taken the soul out of ourselves and placed them inside machines\nMy words, of course, will be marginalized, demonized in typical fashion. Any time you dare to question the power structure they say you hate America. No, I love this country. I see its beauty every day in its people. And I love it a lot more than those who have abandoned the American worker that have chose to exploit and try to take away every single benefit she has, those that attempt to make excuses for every atrocity committed, in the name of supposed freedom. Those who demand accountability from everyone, but offer none themselves... who favor contracts over lives... Who favor invasion and control over organic democracy overseas\n\nThe greatest flaw that any intelligent person has is to think that they\u2019re smarter than everyone else. And so as the government has planted its spies amongst us, we have planted our spies among them. They have infiltrated every branch of the American government. They have retrieved names, data, hard numbers. The paper trail that will expose those that truly control this country, those that control the political parties, those that control the oil industry, the energy. Those that stand behind the companies faceless, whose names have never been revealed\n\nUntil tod.. (GUNSHOT)You might also like3Embed"

I'm out.\nI feel like asome arroz con pollo, a banana daiquiri, and a motherfuckin bistec empanado.You might also likeEmbed"

I'm the blood that pumps in your ventricles\nTechnique, I'm like your soul, nigga, indispensable\nWith no respect for those who cower at the hour of revolution\n'Cause the government owes my people restitution\nInstead of sedatives like cocaine and prostitution\nConclusion is that you'll have to violently silence me\n'Cause I raid the airwaves of cutthroat piracy\nIn school my teachers blinded me, but now I can see\nNow I'm mentally and revolutionarily free\nBroadenin' horizons about what my people could be\nIf we wasn't set up to get shot, locked, or OD\nYou see families bleed because of corporate greed\nAnd monopolizin' weed is virtually impossible\nSo it won't be legalized, and that's another obstacle\nBut I'm still rollin' up pocket fulls of tropical\nThe government's involved directly, so it's unstoppable\nLike a nuclear rocket full of biochemical toxins\nThat invade the ecological\nImprobable that the average intellect could understand\nSo I encrypted this into hip hop that's in high demand\nAnd spread it through the ghetto of every city like contraband\nStomp a man of any complexion with a devilish nature\n'Cause I'm tryin' to save the Earth\nBut you're just gettin' in line to rape herYou might also like4Embed"

Du Bois versus Marcus Garvey\nAnd we ended up, selling out to everybody\nThe Dutch Schultz and John Gotti's\nBanksters, modern day gangsters\nImmobile army\nThey wanna move us all out the NYC\nLike they did to the Jews\nWith the Alhambra Decree\nSo support your own businesses and do the knowledge\nCause the real Harlem Renaissance is economic\nYou might also like[Refrain]\n\n[Outro]\nWhen they were saying it is the renaissance of Harlem\nThey didn't mean that we had stake in that\nThey meant to say that they could make money out of us\nThey are coming in with all kinds of prejudices\nIn Brooklyn they're doing the same thing\nIn Queens they're doing the same thing\nThe Bronx, there's hardly any place which is affordable\nI mean those people are putting up condominiums which start from a million dollars\nHow many people in this community make that kind of money\nHow many people HAVE that kind of money\nPeople of Harlem, they are the natural allies of the oppressed people of the world\nWhether the struggle is in Panama, in Africa, Cuba\nWe spend money with the wrong people\nWe are looking for love with people\nWho don't love us\nWhat's wrong with loving each other and making sure we are protected3Embed"

Buck! Buck! Cause I don't give a motherfuck!\n\n[Verse 2: Beast 1333]\nYo, the world a\ufeff mess, we all lust the flesh\nI won't stop till the people see success\nSo many beat to death, so many people left\nWith the mark of the beast, can't cheat the test\nYou bear the mark, I bear the mark\nWith the blood in the waters they're for sharks\nNow everybody want to be quoting Marx\nLess of the bite, and more of a bark\nIn a world of fakes, here's what it takes\nGotta have big balls, not baby grapes\nAt a crazy pace, let's do it face-to-face\nThe whole race chase waste space age sensash\nWith a warm embrace, they go and stab your back\nIt's so wack that the hacks flapjack the tracks\nAnd when the bombs attack we gon' bomb 'em back\nWhit the cold facts rap tracks catch a jax\nThere's no latch attached, you can't own a soul\nSo don't go go scroll, Po Po Patrol\nLet's go toe to toe like pro dojo\nThrows sold yo' soul, so don't go so slow\nNo need to crow, no need to flip\nWhat we need is a change in leadership\nWon't even give a\ufeff chance to plead the fifth\nBefore the radar go from bleep to blip, bitch!\nYou might also like[Hook 2]\nI blame it on the government, say it one the radio\nAnd if you don\u2019t already know\nI have a devil in my infrared scope\nBuck buck buck! Cause I don\u2019t give a motherfuck!\nI blame it on the government\nEvery president we ever had lied!\nAnd my hand\u2019s on the 16-shot\nSemi-automatic crooked cop killing Glock!\n\n[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]\nYou think I don't notice the line when you cross it?\nI'm like the mind of a genius trapped in a cerebral palsy\nYou underestimate the hood, you think niggas is stupid\nWe read the country's credits, niggas know who produced it\nWhy the fuck you think they're pushing military recruitment?\nAmerica been platinum, and she afraid of recoupment\nSo when you try to close the border, and don't let us in\nI'll overthrow California with 20 million Mexicans\nCubans and Chinese who came looking for freedom\nTill they realized America was run by demons\nAnd I don't mean George Bush, he was a fuckin' zero\nMore like the Roman emperor Nero\nWho did nothing while the black slum turned to Atlantis\nI mean those behind the canvas that made the mechanics\nAnd then planned it\nIt sounds simple, but stupid niggas won't understand it\nUntil the mark of the beast has your face branded, nigga\n[Hook 3]Embed"

The fuck is that?\nNiggas need to start playing their position, man\nJust cause you throw a party, a hosting event, or an open mic or a showcase, or a battle\nThat don't make you important at all\nWithout me and everybody like me out there\nYou ain't nutting but a good idea, motherfucker\nSo stay in your place\nAnd to all these bitchass A&Rs who are too lazy to come up with a way to sell records..\nThat they keep recycling marketing schemes and imagery\nC'mon..\nThere is a market for everything man\nThere is a market for pet psychologists nigga. There is a market for twisted\nShitfetish video's. For nipplerings, for riverdancing, for chocolate covered roaches..\nBut you can't find one for cultured hardcore reality and hip-hop?\nPeople like you: the house nigga executives\nAnd them rich motherfuckers that own you; you the motherfucking machine man!\nYou and all these niggas talking about the same shit\nWith the same flow over the same candy-ass beats\nBut I refuse the feed the machine\nAnd Im not giving any magazine money\nSo maybe my album won't get 5 mics, or double-x-l's, or 5 discs\nWhatever man, fuck it\nBut then again; you don't own me, and none of you niggas ever will\nIf I'm feeling what you fight for I'm rolling with you to the end\nBut if not, then FUCK YOU!\nAnd the more that mc's, producers, dj's\nAnd independent labels start to grasp the conceptuality\nOf what their contribution to the business of hiphop is\nRather then just the music - the more the industry will be forced to change\n\nOh , heh, and one last thing;\n\nYou don't have to agree with everything I've said\nBut don't ever be condescending to me\nPicking up your wack ass friends that rhyme and being like\n'Ow yeah, Immortal Technique - he's aaiight'\nNo nigga..\nYour mom is pussy, that's aaiight, ok..\nYour peoples getting shot dead in the street, that's aaiight\nI'm the motherfucking Immortal Technique nigga! The message and the money!\nAnd you ain't got either!\nRemember that!\nPunk ass motherfucker..You might also likeEmbed"

Kelly piss on your kids\nHere's the ultimatum mothafucka\nGive me that *ASCAP*\nOr give America Biggie and 2Pac flashbacks\nSome niggas don't think the Underground is grimy and dirty\n'Til they find your body on a fucking highway in Jersey\nI fire rockets at generic topics\nYour lyrics don't hold weight\nLike two-dimensional objects\nCause jail culture didn't give you that fitted hat\nTo memorize a ghostwritten shit verse and spit it back\nI won't let your wack rhymes redefine lyricism\nFor a whole generation with their fathers in prison\nYou live inside the image of an Era that's gone\nLike government officials trying to justify Vietnam\nI'll leave niggas traumatized like they momma died\nAnd they was responsible for the driveby homicide\nAnd I don't market revolution, I live it\nWhat you think cause you fake everyone else is a gimmick\nJealous bickering, industry slaves, the nerve of you\nLike a child prostitute born into a life of servitude\nUntil we murder you making the red carpet burgundy\nThe Psycho Realm and the streets were I prefer to be\n[Hook: Immortal Technique]\nHollywood Driveby, motherfucking murderfest\nWeed clouds in the air that cause turbulence\n'Revolution' motherfucka you heard of it\nI light the spliff with the flag while Im burning it\nHollywood Driveby, spraying the cucarachas\nWar with the system like the streets of Oaxaca\nYea 'Revolution' motherfucka yea you scared of it\nWell its coming to the industry now so be prepared for it\n\n[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]\nYou're on some bullshit tracks I spit them full clip raps\nWhile most of these 'gangsta rappers' are some full fledge rats\nThe real Gs stay strapped in full combat\nWhat you see in the videos is full on acts\nThe streets don't believe you homie\nArmaggeddon in the rap game is coming and we lead the army\nRock 'Terror Tape' out of your sounds\nGot hostages in pink, this is what they call hip hop now\nI keep that metro shit out of my whip\nMan that dummy rap is thru, making money is about to extinct\nYou know the radio is trying to kill rap with that shit\nThe only thing dying is the DJs when the K spit\nWe'll hit his CEOs and blow up A&Rs\nIm taking your chips like crashing your game of cards\nThis is how I eat holmes I will give you bars\nAnd take the life of these stars for the state of ours\nYou might also like[Hook: Immortal Technique]\nHollywood Driveby, motherfucking murderfest\nWeed clouds in the air that cause turbulence\n'Revolution' motherfucka you heard of it\nI light the spliff with the flag while Im burning it\nHollywood Driveby, spraying the cucarachas\nWar with the system like the streets of Oaxaca\nYea 'Revolution' motherfucka yea you scared of it\nWell its coming to the industry now so be prepared for it\n\n[Verse 3: Sick Symphonies]\nIm from the city of fallen stars the home of bangin hard\nWaitin for them at the Radio City Hall to snatch em out their fuckin cars\nExpose em for what they are: narcs, jakes, snake informants\nFeeding us horse shit, blaze up all of them\nThey say hip hop doesn't exist\nRappers talking hard dressed up like punk rock kids\nPumped up by some corporate endorsement dead corpses are voiceless\nNo one hears ya homie, ya little fame is over\nWe'll send little homies for closer like bankers cuz you owe us the mortgage\nFor exploiting the lifestyle that many died, jailed up for storage\nLeaving most of us hopeless homies radio focused\nWhat we're building got em all afraid\nGimme the K I'll be honored to ignite the flame\nThat'll burn down the game, whats fame? Keep it..\nA movement.. a sonic war, motherfucka you sleepin\n[Hook: Immortal Technique]\nHollywood Driveby, motherfucking murderfest\nWeed clouds in the air that cause turbulence\n'Revolution' motherfucka you heard of it\nI light the spliff with the flag while Im burning it\nHollywood Driveby, spraying the cucarachas\nWar with the system like the streets of Oaxaca\nYea 'Revolution' motherfucka yea you scared of it\nWell its coming to the industry now so be prepared for it4Embed"

I made a mistake... yes I did)\n\nHuh..ya know living this type a life\nMakes you grow up faster than you'd expect to sometimes...\nFuck around and be in your late twenties...\nFeelin like a old man and shit...\nYeah for real son... let em know\n\nIt's hard to breath and hard to run when your lung's blackened\nCoughing up blood like what the fuck happened\nRaising my risk of cancer's the answer homie\nBut after drinking something there's nothing like puffing a bogie\nNow I can blame the same product placement in movies\nOr the commercials, or Scarface in a jacuzzi\nBut now I'm living it\nDamn I should a never took that first cigarette\n(I made a mistake)\n\nI fucked up, like your girl was riding on top of me\nI should of took her to trial and never copped a plea\nBut this ain't a Christian nation motherfucka please\nAmerica never taught me to turn the other cheek\nCause I'm from Harlem, the north of Manhattan\nWe knock niggas out and make em bounce like Ricky Hatton\nBut wildin on the corner got me turned back from the Canadian border\n\n(I made a mistake)\n\nI knew she was a virgin, when I first met her\nRockin stockings and poppin out of the catholic school sweater\nMom told her she could do better than a criminal\nSeventeen year-old psychotic, trying to be lyrical\nI never meant to break her heart or fuck up her life\nBut I was careless, instead of treating her right\nI seen her again at some club strippin and wondered\nIf I could have made her life different\n\n(I made a mistake... yes I did... )\n\n[Tech talking over the beat:\nDamn shortie, you got me on some singin the blues shit...\nBut you gotta stop looking backwards and remember to look ahead...\nThis is for all my dudes on patrol in the desert right now... for real]\nYou might also like(I made a mistake)\n\nYeah..yeah... I joined the army looking for money to go to college\nBut they ain't pay me a quarter of what they fucking promised\nExtended my tour, treating me like a sucker\nThat's the reason officers get fragged motherfucker\nDon't give me speeches on how you respect and you love me\nBut no body armor in a lightly armored humvee?!\nMy family's lonely and you want me to reenlist for 30 grand homie?\n\n(I made a mistake)\n\nWhen I was young I got signed to a record label\nThe deal looked so good when it was on the table\nIt paid for my cable, cribs, cars and jewelry\nThe studios, the women there's nothing they wouldn't do for me\nExcept stop screwing me for publishing and royalties\nHow the fuck are you my dawg, when there's no loyalty?\nWord to the street\nI should've gone independent like Immortal Technique\n\n(I made a mistake)\n\nSome people learn from mistakes and don't repeat them\nOthers try to block the memories and just delete them\nBut I keep em as a reminder they not killing me\nAnd I thank God for teaching me humility\nSon, remember when you fight to be free\nTo see things how they are and not how you like em to be\nCause even when the world is falling on top of me\nPessimism is an emotion, not a philosophy\nKnowing what's wrong doesn't imply that you right\nAnd its another, when you suffer to apply it in life\nBut I'm no rookie\nAnd I'm never gonna make the same mistake twice pussy2Embed"

Bring it to 'em raw)\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nI told you what it was, but this is what it is now\n50 caliber bullets, I don't need a clip now\nFuck your private jet nigga we shooting the shit down\nBomb wall street and make the stock market dip down\nI told you what it was, but this is what it is now\nYou the shit nigga? I don't care about shit now\nI play the role of Abraham, idols get ripped down\nMelt the ice caps, and make all of this shit drown\n\n(No one out there can fuck with me)\n(motherfucka what?)\n(I speak that real shit)\n(to smash the airwaves)\n(I don't want to tell you motherfuckers again)\n\n[Outro]\n{Deep Cover-1992}\n\n[David Jason]\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed a new product.

Like you drivin' in a lightning storm\nWith the top down, we got this locked down\nLike convicts on the run, gettin' shot down for phone time\nWe gainin' yards in the whole nine\nSee, me and Tech, we steadily building\nAnd we about to blow like the Oklahoma Federal Building\nAnd all them niggas get mad when we step in the building 'Cause we make the crowd jump\nAnd hit they head on the ceiling, what\n\n[Scratches]\n\n[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]\nI spit heat like the deserts of Saudi Arabia\nBury competition like Mesopotamia\nEmanatin' radiation, pissin' liquid uranium\nI bring the rock like European drunks in soccer stadiums\nI'll split your cranium with perfect symmetry, lyrically\nIf you're not the illest, then you don't deserve to spit with me\nOBS-obliterating bastards sacrilegiously\nI sacrifice niggas who talk shit, ritualistically\nMeticulously makin' all my rivals suicidal\nLike white suburban kids on acid, readin' the Satanic Bible\nMy arrival is genocidal like Christopher Columbus\nExterminatin' races of wack MC's that walk among us\nI've just begun to bust, I'll make this place open candela\nThese racist cops wanna lock me longer then Nelson Mandela\nPissed off, I'm makin' hella paper, East to West Coast\nAnd I treat the law in this country like a motherfuckin' joke\n'Cause if I'm willin' to smoke the President\nWhile he's sniffin' his coke\nYou know it don't mean shit to me to cut a fuckin' cop's throat\nYou might also like[Outro: Immortal Technique]\nJean Grae, Pumpkinhead, Immortal Technique\nDP-one, tell 'em what the fuck we about to do!\n{Sh, sh, sh, shit on the whole industry}5Embed"

    "plain": "The 13th track is taken from a speech by Professor and activist John Henrick Clarke. Born the son of an Alabama sharecropper, Professor Clarke was a celebrated and influential professor and activist.  He was instrumental in establishing Pan-African and Africana Studies in academia, beginning in 1969 when he served as the founding chairman of the new Black and Puerto Rican Studies department at Hunter College, without ever having earned a high school diploma.

   "lyrics": "Homeland and Hip-Hop Lyrics[Mumia Abu-Jamal]\nHomeland and Hip-Hop\nTo think about the origins of hip-hop in this culture and also about Homeland Security is to see that there are, at the very least, two worlds in America: one of the well-to-do and another of the struggling. For if ever there was the absence of homeland security, it is seen in the gritty roots of hip-hop. For the music arises from a generation that feels, with some justice, that they have been betrayed by those who came before them, that they are at best tolerated in schools, feared on the streets, and almost inevitably destined for the hell holes of prison. They grew up hungry, hated, and unloved, and this is the psychic fuel that generates the anger that seems endemic in much of the music and poetry. One senses very little hope above the personal goals of wealth to climb above the pit of poverty. In the broader society, the opposite is true, for here, more than any other place on earth, wealth is so widespread and so bountiful that what passes for the middle class in America could pass for the upper class in most of the rest of the world. Their very opulence and relative wealth makes them insecure and homeland security is a governmental phrase that is as oxymoronic as crazy as saying military intelligence, or the U.S Department of Justice. They're just words, they have very little relationship to reality. Now do you feel safer now? Do you think you will anytime soon? Do you think duct tape and Kleenex and color codes will make you safe?\nFrom Death Row, this is Mumia Abu-Jamal\n\n[Sample from the film Contact]\nThere are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders that would like to see me depart this Earth. I'll grant them their wish soon enough. But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution, a final gesture of goodwill to the people of this little planet that have given\u2014from whom I have taken\u2014so muchYou might also like2Embed"

Welcome to the 3rd World\n\n[Immortal Technique]\nYeah.. Yeah..\nInvasion and rampant monetary inflation\nThat brought us all to the footsteps of this nation\nPeruvians, Haitians, Ecuadorians, Nicaraguans, Colombians, Salvadorians\nInvasion and rampant monetary inflation\nThat brought us all to the footsteps of this nation\n[2x]\n\nInvasion and rampant monetary inflation\nThat brought us all to the footsteps of this nation\nPeruvians, Haitians, Ecuadorians, Nicaraguans, Colombians, Salvadorians\nThey call us terrorists after they ruined our countries\nFunding right-wing paramilitary monkeys\nTortured our populace then blamed the communists\nYour lies are too obvious, propaganda monotonous\nAnd that's not socialist mythology\nThis is urban warfare through the streets of your psychology\nSo I'm like the legs of a paraplegic really\nCause I'm still part of you even if you can't feel me\nYou can never debate me, The M4s at your baby\nLike troops with gats in Iraq do daily\nSo you can marginalize the way you portray me\nBut don't get Hollywood and try to play me\nWe can shoot it out in the theater like troops in the 80s\nNew Jack City classic crack era, mack-milli\nShouting BET is not black-owned on Rap City\nYou got a contract to kill me motherfucker, that's fine\nCause there's a contract to kill your family when I die\nSo when your car explodes, don't be surprised\nSoldier, I'm like Marine Corp C4\nEven blow the spot with the beat rocking at 3/4\nCanvas the flow like the ghost of Michelangelo\nThis is the anthem, Immortal Technique and Green Lantern\nDon't say shit bitch, you don't want the \"check, check\"\nTo become a ::chick, chick:: You know what I'm sick with\nLyrical tuberculosis, cocaine overdoses\nBlood coming out your noses, that's when death approaches\nMarch to my death smiling, laugh if the end's violent\nThere's no escape from this political asylum\nYou might also likeRevolutionaries don't fear execution\nCause the death of my visible Constitution\nIs just the beginning of spiritual evolution\nGod will reincarnate me as revolution\n\n[DJ Green Lantern]\nYou can't take out a revolution\nYou can't kill a idea\nFuck is you stupid?\nYou kill that man, he becomes Immortal\n\n[Immortal Technique]\nIgnore the triplets, this is a fully loaded four-four\n3rd World underground hardcore\nStreet-hop, locked and loaded, motherfucker you should know it\nBlast the door to the game open and overthrow it4Embed"

Yeah... yeah, uhh, yeah\n[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]\nThe game is polluted with rappers that are really snitches\nAnd most DJ's are nothin but, industry bitches\nAnd we don't got, no mansion or riches\nBut we got guns and knives and your children's pictures\nAnd everybody loses in war, but you lose more\nWhat you think we brought back the Panthers, and the Zulu for?\nImmortal witchdoctor made himself a voodoo doll\nFor every motherfucker that fronted that I can recall\nFuck the industry, don't call me, you can't get with me\nI'll leave niggas hangin like Mississippi\nRBG to the last drop of blood in my body\nOr the Feds drag me away, like a tsunami\nBut I'll be back like a fresh bodybag from Iraq\nLike a Baltimore slum during the resurgence of crack\nBrown and black like the A.K. I keep in the strap\nWhile we waitin on the next stock market collapse!\n\n[Verse 2: Da Circle]\nIt's territorial, oratory editorial\nFuck around I'll be the cause of your life's memorial\nI write rap's territorial, East Coast border zoo\nNever crossin waters 'til I will coastally slaughter you\nI'm better than all of you, vendetta's be mauling you\nYou're talkin cheddar, I'm a shreddar, I'll sever it off of you\nI'll never remorse for you, no letters endorsin you\nPole position in the coffin is what it's, costin you\nThe cockiest bosses who control the fortunes too\nThe mortgage is of a cultural losses, through and through\n(But it's the rebel arms!) Godspeed with devil's charms\nThe bitch-made gets switchblades in every arm\nAnd this way we ix-nay on any harm\nCause snakes play and fakes lay like hidden bombs\nWe march in unison, the soul is true within\nEternal missions with church, a lifetime to do it in\nYou might also likeStronghold said it, whoop yo' bitch-ass with batons\nThe rebel arms swarm and form like Voltron\nSlash your own beast, you heard +Mark of the East+\nRunnin through cop lands screamin \"Fuck the police!\"\nHormones in the water (water) they actin out of order\nLike a pack of rabid wolves, they lambs for the slaughter\nCrush your mandible, rip the drums like Animal\nEat MC's they my own kind, I'm a cannibal\nMy regimen salute me, haters wanna shoot me\nKool-Aid in their veins, they're lawyers tryin to sue me\n\"You sell crack and rap, did a skid bid\nMultiple baby mamas, take care of yo' kids\"\n\nGuillotine rap, shackles on your neck\nChemical warfare where punchlines connect\nDa Circle play the snipers, with Immortal Tech'\nThey called the block governor to drag him of the set!\n\n[J. Arch]\nRebel arms out for supremacy and move non-gimmicky\nRelated to royalty on each trip you mention me\nTwist bars illest-ly, rebel against the infantry\nGet more than yo' feet wet when I make you a memory\nCats not ready because they commercially industry\nI make house calls to those afraid to visit me\nDisrespect, I'll smash off the petty\nFrom undisclosed locates, move fast for their cheddy\nArch don't breakdance, yet I +Rock Steady+\nI jump on your scope to prove your aim not deadly\nMy shot to the top is like Mikki and Mal' smelly\nFlow milky like the tits of a chick, that's top heavy\nThe +Technique's Immortal+ so Rebel Arm's the regiment\nArch status nicer than, other rappers ever been\nMy cantine's full from when the doc don't got medicine\nFive-star general, frontline veteran\n[Outro: DJ Green Lantern]\nInvasion baby!\nShit ain't a fuckin game that we playin\nImmortal Technique...\nOh yeah, don't forget\n\"Revolutionary Vol. 3\" comin soon\nYou're not worthy, you sons-of-bitches!3Embed"

Our parents survived the Middle Passage. Only the strong got here, and then we lost our name, our culture, our religion, and we're still here. So you may have a momentary victory, Mr. Bush, but you don't know who we are.\"\n\n[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]\nI pledge no allegiance, fuck the President's speeches!\nWhat the industry did to 'Pac they did to Jesus\nRapin' his vocals, and then destroyin' the message\nTryin' to deport us if they can't destroy and arrest us\nGovernment front religious, but their heart is empty\nLike a televangelist preachin' out of his Bentley\nCallin' abortion murder in a medical building\nBut don't give a fuck about bombin' Iraqi children\nTalkin' like units in the fuckin' libretto\nLook at their mansions and look at your suburban ghetto\nThe gulag, the new hood where they send us to live\n'Cause they don't give a fuck about none of our kids\nThat's why Blacks and Latinos get the worst education\nWhile devils run America like Birth of a Nation\nAffirmative action ain't reverse discrimination\nThat shit is a pathetic excuse for reparations\n[Hook: KRS-One]\nBin Laden didn't blow up the projects\nIt was you, nigga, it was you\nBush knocked down the towers\nIt was you, nigga, it was you\nIt was you, motherfucker!\n\n[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\nThey say that terrorism revolves around the Qur'an\nBut that is stupid, I'll show you why it's totally wrong\n'Cause if this country was invaded and crumbled\nI'd turn Harlem into a Columbian jungle\nAnd I wouldn't be fightin' for a Christian nation\nI'd be fightin' for survival from extermination\nI wouldn't fight for Fox News, them racist niggas\nI'd be fightin' for the hood, for the faceless niggas\nFor the immigrants America loves to despise\nEven though it needs them to make the economy rise\nThey feed us genetically-modified garbage\nSo I repetitively reload the cartridge\nBoston, New York, down to Atlanta\nGuerilla war in the swamps of Louisiana\nCamera panoramas of hammers couldn't rock me\nEast Coast to West Coast, you can't stop me\nAnd fuck Schwarzenegger, his pops was a Nazi\nAnd it runs in the family, so run for the Grammy's\nRun to the coon picnic and try to pick up a mammy\nBut half of y'all are faggots tryin' to pick up a tranny\nEddie Murphy-ass motherfuckers goin' commercial\nEven Interscope is gettin' pimped by Universal\nGreen Tutankhamen Lantern, I curse you and murk you\nBut the Bin Laden slush fund remix just burked you\nYou might also like[Hook: KRS-One]\nBin Laden didn't blow up the projects\nIt was you, nigga, it was you\nBush knocked down the towers\nIt was you, nigga, it was you\nIt was you, motherfucker!2Embed"

Where you aimin' at?\nWhere the fuck you niggas aimin' at?\nWhere you aimin' at? Where you aimin' at?\nThis is only for the hardcore wherever you at, yeah\n[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]\nVolume 1, cop killer, hip-hop has never been realer\nVolume 2 shot up the president like a guerilla\nNew York police state capital tried to swallow me\nLocked me longer than Puerto Rico been a colony\nThirteenth Amendment slavery property\nAnd now they signin rappers that promote their philosophy\nFuck that, nigga hip-hop is not Republican\nThat's just the white motherfuckers that own the publishin\nAnd get the fuck out, if you want the foreigners gone\nI paint the White House black and park my car on the lawn\nMarry a Muslim girl and fuck her five times a day\nEvery time right before we shower and pray\nYou damn right the AK, symbolizes Jihad\nBut a holy war, is a conversation with God\nYou bitch niggas misinterpret what you don't understand\nStackin' the wrong sign can end up, shootin' your man\nShootin' each other, shootin' your brother\nAim the gun at the right motherfucker\nAnd leave him colder than the prison in Russia\nOr America's white power structure\nNiggas love to say \"Fuck revolution!\"\nUntil the jury come in and move for the prosecution\nAnd then brothers act like a born-again Huey Newton\nForgot about the bullshit music they was producin'\nBut my niggas aim precisely, through the confusion and\nYou might also like[Hook]\nLick shots, lick shots, lick shots\nLick shots for the revolution!\nLick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots\nBut watch, where the fuck you shootin'!\nYo, where you aimin' at?

Where you aimin' at?\nThis is only for the hardcore wherever you at, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: KXNG Crooked]\nI got a hundred shooters with me, Ruger shoot you through the kidney\nStand in front of the judge and lie quicker than Scooter Libby\nI'm runnin' through the city, dear God\nIf I murk the racist Rush Limbaugh I wonder would you forgive me\nSomebody told me Glenn Beck is the Klan\u2019s overseer\nSee ya, time to let him see a damn soldier\nFlip your Landrover, I told ya I blam toasters\nGun pop off like the mouth of Ann Coulter\nThis is my gangsta religion\nSee I aim with precision, point blank the position\nI'm black as them ancient Egyptians\nBefore European historians went and changed the description\nI'm blamed for the 'caine in the kitchen\nThe C.I.A. playin' with the pigeons, same pain that I'm pitchin'\nListen, you dudes better watch the hook\nI'm a boxer, coppers'll come up, Hoffa, look\nThey wanna get rid of this conscious crook\nLike I'm an agnostic, apocryphal, non-canonical Gospel book\nBut I ain't goin' nowhere, that's the motherfuckin' truth\nAmerica don't care for its inner city youth, so I\n[Hook]\nLick shots, lick shots, lick shots\nLick shots for the revolution!\nLick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots\nBut watch, where the fuck you shootin'!\nYo, where you aimin' at?

Blap! I shoot the cats off your fuckin' Pumas\n\n[Hook]\nLick shots, lick shots, lick shots\nLick shots for the revolution!\nLick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots\nBut watch, where the fuck you shootin'!\nYo, where you aimin' at?

You know, the post is always on some bias racist bullshit, man. Word, I mean, on The Daily News\u2026\n\u2014 (Laughs) Word, I feel you\u2026\n\u2014 They ridiculous, man. Times are better, but they still on some bullshit!\n\u2014 (Laughs) I know that, man. (Hiss)\n\u2014 Another nigga killed by these fucking cops, yo!\n\u2014 What? Word? Psh\u2026\n\u2014 See, that's why I gotta get the fuck outta here, man. I need some peace. I need something like that or I'ma just start blastin' these fucking pigs, man!\n\u2014 I feel you, son. (laughs)\n\u2014 For real, yo!\n\u2014 Yo, son, fuck it then. Let's do somethin', man, let's see some mamis out there!\n\u2014 You know what? Matter of fact, pack the bags\u2026\n\u2014 Aight then!\n\u2014 Start the fucking whip up! I'm outta here, yo, for real!\n[Verse: Immortal Technique]\nYo, I hate my job, so I always look to a better day\nFar from New York City on a tropical getaway\nBut not in Miami\n\u2018Cause these white Cuban anti-Castro's can't stand me\nAnd that's the reason I'll never win a fixed up Latin Grammy\nAfter this racist Latinos'll goddamn me\nBut my black people love me\nAnd when I go to South America, people be tryna hug me\n\u2018Cause I talk about reality that effects them\nAnd even though I blew up I could never neglect them\nWhat kind of a revolutionary action would that be?\nI be categorizing practically every other MC\nBut never that, \u2018cause I'm clever with facts, sever your raps\nFake players and thugs will forever be whack\nI'm still rollin' with my squadron heavily strapped\nAnd even if I get killed I'll inevitably be back\nEncyclopedia Hispanica over digital dat\nDon't ever compare me with small-minded criminal cats\nI kill kids on tracks, like Dale Earnhardt\nSpit in your face and leave your cheekbone with a burn mark\nI was born a genius, but I learned to be street smart\nMy vacation just started, I'm out to the Caribbean\nSwimmin' in Dominican women the color of cinnamon\nYou mothafuckers wish you had the lifestyle I'm livin' in\nYou might also like[Hook: Immortal Technique]\nEast Coast to West Coast and everything in between\nThis is dedicated to everybody chasing their dreams\nThis ghetto fabulous life really ain't what it seems\nBut I'ma make it, \u2018cause I got survival stuck in my genes\n\n[Outro: Immortal Technique]\nWord up (Word!) Immoral Technique\nRepresenting Harlem\nAll the way out to my fam, in Englewood\nI'm out, mothafucker! (Laughs the ghetto way, nigga!)1Embed"

   "lyrics": "In Da Club Freestyle LyricsI know I look like Immortal Technique to you\nBut I created this genetic clone just to speak to you\nMe and 279 are plantin' a bomb in the building\n'Cause underground shows never got women and children\nI'm serial-killin' every fake nigga alive\nSo most people tryin' to rap won't survive\nMachine-gun everything around me like a panorama\nAnd burn rubber with the ghost of Princess Diana\nI'm like Santana: pullin' strings in the game\nWhile slaves emulate their masters livin' the same\nForget the fame, I can't rest a second alone\nI got homeland security tappin' my phone\nBut here's a warning to the government that creeps on me\nI'm like a cum-stained mattress: don't sleep on me\nI roll deep, with a fully loaded AK\nMurder cowards in their sleep like the IRA\nI represent Zone 4 Dawg, that's the best hood\nYou catch a shot while you sittin' in your whip\nLike Tim Westwood\nWhilin' out, you know how we doin' persuin'\nAnd this is freestyle in the meanwhile\nOther cats are spittin' a written bitten composition\nYou're crushed into submission\nThis is Harlem, you'll never rise to stardom, kid\nI came down to London, and you know how we did\nAnd this is off the dome, off of the brain, lyrically insane\nAnd that's how I'm trippin', that's how I'm flippin'\nAyo, check it out, now I'm the illest Latino\nI never had to buy an album back like Benzino\nYou know I'm sick with the flow, spittin' it slow\nAnd yo, I had to go to the bathroom, I made a scramble\nI lost 10 pounds, and I don't even gamble\nSo you know what's happenin'\nWhen I'm rockin' it off of the brain, lyrically insane\nImmortal Technique, sayin' you nice as me, dawg?\nYou straight tellin' lies\nMe and you have never been even like Biggie Smalls' eyes\nWhen will you realize Immortal Technique is iller?\nThe socialist guerrilla, stomp you like a stone pillar\nComin' through, representin' whoever\nCleverly, under the weather, yo, it's like that\nThe Latin assassin will make it happen\nI'm about to go platinum, but when you see me up in the spot\nRockin' it hip-hop off the top of the knot\nAnd yo, that's how it goes, that's how it flows\nThat's how it shows, ayo, it's 96.9\nAyo, I substract the same numbers from both sides\nAnd that's 5-9, and that's fine, and I continue to climb\nI continue to shine, I continue to climb\nThe voice of racism preachin' the gospel, ayo, that's devilish\nA church in America called the prophet Muhammad a terrorist\nForgettin' God is not a religion, but a spiritual bond\nAnd Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Qu'ran\nThey bombin' innocent people, tryin' to murder Saddam\nWhen they gave him those chemical weapons\nTo go to war with Iran\nThis is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings\n'Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a New Age Sally Hemmings\nI break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish\nThe Judas I hang with, the guilt of betrayin' Christ\nYou murdered him, stole his religion, and painted him white\nTranslated in psychologically tainted philosophy\nConservative political right wing, ideology\nGlued together sloppily, the blasphemy of a nation\nI got my back to the wall, I'm facin' assassination\nGuantanamo Bay, federal incarceration\nHow could this be, the land of the free, home of the brave?\nIndigenous holocaust, and the home of the slaves\nCorporate America dancin' offbeat to the rhythm\nThey really think this country never sponsored terrorism\nHuman rights violations, we continue the saga\nEl Savador and the contras in Nicaragua\nAnd on top of that, they still wanna take me to prison\nJust 'cause I won't trade humanity for patriotism\nAyo, I'm still buggin' out, I know you flipped the instrumental\nWhich is coincidental, I'm spittin' off the top of the mental\nAyo, this government is tappin' my phone\nLike I told you before, I'm keepin' it raw\nI smash your kids hands in a car door\nAnd thats how it goes, you know there\u2019s ill and there's crazy\nImmortal Technique blazingly, amazing MC's\nYo, I'm hangin' out with the illest rappers alive\nAnd yo, I strive to be better, I strive to survive\nI strive to strap a live wire to the top of my brain\nI make cuts on my dick with masochistic tactics\nAnd then take a fat ish\nWhile simultaneously stabbin' a pregnant fat bitch\nOn a vomit-covered mattress\nWhile the featus uses my dick to practice gymnastics\nDancin' on it like a balance beam, doin' backflips\nAyo, I smack kids, and I compact them, ayo, I subtract them\nAnd I'm keepin' this freestyle from the brain\nI'm lyrically insane, let me explain\nAyo, let me give you the rap-up from 2003\nPeople went to war and they tried to drag me and everyone else, and now we about to put Tony Blair back on the shelf\nWe're takin' it over, my word to Jehovah\nI don't got a Range Rover, I be in the tube, I be at the [\u2026]\nSpittin' on people's faces and whilin' out\nAyo, no doubt, I keep it complete, Immortal Technique\nAnd I can even flip it in Spanish, make rappers vanish\n{Proceeds to rap in Spanish}\nLike, Immortal Technique, I be chillin', with my boy Clamento\nAyo, Ralph Dogg dot com, log on, so we can drop bombs\nYo, Bragging Rights to hook dot com\nTo Rock Steady, you're not ready\nWon every battle in New York city\nYour style is not pretty, kinda like Macy Gray\nAhaha, and my faith in God is kinda shitty\nI'll put my hand on a Bible and tell Whoopi that she's pretty\nAnd this is some mean stuff\nThat I'm spittin' off the top of the brain\nAyo, you know how I rock, 2-7-9\nThat means you catchin' eighteen shots\nAnd that's how it goes, and that's how it flows\nAnd I'm out of here, I'm out with your ho\nI'm with your masters and the cash in the Jetta\nSinceramente Technique, end of the letterYou might also like3Embed"

I'll leave you laid out in the street\nSigned yours truly, the motherfuckin' Immortal TechniqueYou might also like1Embed"

Are you fuckin serious?)\nYeah, I'm dead serious baby, I'm comin home (oh my God!)\nPut the little blue thing on for me, aight?\n(You got that baby, yeah!)\n\n[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]\nI'm on parole, and I'll never be alone again\nFuck this place baby, I'm comin home again\nShorty wrapped around me so I'll, never be cold again\nNever have to knock a nigga out, for the phone again\nPrison ain't the place that you find your rite of passage in\nIt is slavery, with nasty food in your abdomen\nMiddle passage, bottom of the ship, how they pack 'em in\nPerpetrators on some fake shit, sweeter than saccharin\nJailhouse snitches without corroborating evidence\nNiggas sellin niggas out for true to be, Benjamins\nBut now I'm free, hit the block, eatin Entenmann's\nBenihana in and out, flow to eat to enter in\nNewspaper pencillin, tryin to pay the rent again\nEx-con job interview, nobody answerin\nFeelin violent from the frustation I got pent up in\nBut not tryin to go back to the place, I was sent up in\nTurn my own life around, fuck the establishment\nListenin to hip-hop like, \"Where the fuck the talent went?\"\nHow the fuck did you replace, lyrics with your swaggerin'?\nI'mma fix that, rhymin on with the mag-a-num\nI roll up in a caravan, full of North Africans\nMy squad got, more soldier niggas than the Saracens\n'Cause just watch (watch!), when the terrorists attack again\nTheir reaction's gonna be draft 'em and send us back again\n[Chorus]\nI'm on parole, and I'll never be alone again\nFuck this place baby, I'm comin home again\nShorty wrapped around me so I'll, never be cold again\nNever have to knock a nigga out, for the phone again\nPrison ain't the place that you find your rite of passage in\nIt's slavery, with nasty food in your abdomen\nMiddle passage, bottom of the ship, how they pack 'em in\nPerpetrators on some fake shit, sweeter than saccharin\nI'm on parole1Embed"

I'll leave you laid out in the street\nSigned: Yours truly, the motherfucking Immortal TechniqueYou might also like2Embed"

   "lyrics": "Land of The Gun Lyrics[James Nichols from Bowling for Columbine]\nThem people, law enforcement, if you want to call them that\nWere here and they were shaking in their shoes. They were physically\nShaking, scared to death. Because certain people, said I'm a radical\nI'm a wild man, I got a gun under every arm, if you say anything\nI'll shoot you. If the people find out how they've been\nRipped off, and enslaved, they will revolt with the blood\nRunning in the streets\n\nYo, Ticket to ride, the white crime, highway\nBring all the guns, the funds will come my way\nWhether we deliverin' high grade\nTo the people in the pit of the tri-state\nOr dabble in the hood like fly weights\nLock and load in the range with rock the globe\nMade any aim possible\nTil the leadbelly lost control\nIn the hold of the paper that fold\nAt one time was related to gold\nMade many men lose their soul\nTo the price of the dice that roll\nHow can a light so bright make a man so cold?\nSo another man's plans unfold\nCan you really see the truth til it happens to you\nIts so severe what the hopeless will do\nAin't no pickin' your position to beginning your life\nNot every man want to stand by his kids and his wife\nToo many lost kids in the night\nHand on heat, grippin' it tight\nAny man want beef could get it right\nFollowed by enough flame to put a permanent end\nTo the learning of men\nClass session, too many the blast the last lesson\nOften taught like the wars that are often fought\nAs old as mankind\nNow outta his damn mind\nStand on the gunpowder landmine\nReady to blow at any second\nI'm checking for the signs of the end\nOf all-time, I figure its on time, my last thoughts forming the rhyme\n\nGot me running through the streets\nThat reek of the dead, its more food to the wealthy\nMy niggas on welfare, nobody givin' up healthcare\nNothing but heat, how you gonna tell me it ain't hell here?\nGeorge Bush having a swell year\nSwingin' the gat, ready to clap, anything on the map\nYou done seen what they bring to Iraq\nNow bring it back to the source, land of the physical force\nLand of the gun, land of the gun, land of the gun, land of the gun!\nYou might also likeThis is the place where the cops rush in the building\nParamilitary death squads murder your children\nEmpty shell of a man rippin' shots in the air\nSoldiers dying out there, but nobody cares\nPrepare for the future but make note of the past\nOr be condemned to live it again and get blast\nClass warfare kept outta the news\nReplaced by a corporation's political views\nCause this is where the guns are manufactured and sold\nThe land that was stolen stripped of all of its gold\nOld timers on the death bed speakin' the wisdom\nImmigrants crucified by conservative Christians\nNow we all got freedom to die in the street\nBut the difference is more of us die in a week\nThan they die in a year I made it clear\nWhere I stand when the line is drawn\nBut now the line is gone\nAnd nigga anything goes\nThe land where the guns don't let anything grow\nAnd what the fuck you niggas know about living in hell\nYou not built like me you never lived in a cell\nYou never gambled with your soul\nFuck the ice on your hand, gun in your palm\nBut you got a niggas life in your hand\nYoung man, just remember that slicing a gram\nIs a bloody game, like throwin' mice in a fan\nMy words flow like the rivers thats west of Iran\nThe fertile crescent moon, with the star in the middle\nI reveal the depth of history's scars when I scribble\nI gave you the world, and I ain't even charged you a little\nThe martyr is crippled\nThe prophets are dead and buried, but the message is simple\nAnd its not written down in holy books as a riddle\nNow we running through the streets, starvin'\nOn that guerilla warfare\nMy people stuck in a guerilla warfare\nInnocent children screamin' in tears\nYou actin' like the army ain't put hell here\nMilitary industry havin' a swell year\nSwinging a gat while lying in heaven\nLiving off a blank check after 9/11\nBut I'm have the truth brought back to the source\nFight for my land with physical force\nSpeak through music, the subliminal course\nI need a tech and a clip, fuck a chain and a Porsche\nLand of the gun, land of the gun, land of the gun, land of the gun1Embed"

I'm on a mission\nIf I could be president, I would lower the rent\nAnd make stic.man my secretary of defense\nMy whole cabinet would be niggas who ain't havin' it\nYou think it's fucked up now?\nJust watch how bad it gets\n\n(Just Blaze)\nInvasion!\nI'll push Bush off the White House roof\nCalling chickens coming home to roost, it's overdue\nNiggas taken advantage of, taken for granted\nFor the hungry, for the 'hood, for the good of the planet\nBut not to get it twisted, Bush is only a figurehead\nIt's bigger yet. The whole system needs to be put to death\nIf I was president, then I'd get rid of the whole office\nPimp the system out and make the people the  bosses\nYou might also like(Chorus)\n(Motherfuckers don't realize how serious this mother fucking shit is.)\n\n(Immortal Technique)\nEither stand him, wear the rifle or reach him\nOr some bitch give him a blow job so we can impeach him\nTeach the motherfucker about the drama I bring\nAnd cut Dick Cheney's hands off for pulling the strings\nThis is for all my niggas locked in the P\nThat'll never see the sun until the revolution is bring\nGeorge Bush: the puppet king of the planet\nNigga, he don't care about the marriage of faggots\nHe's got a supreme court full of religious fanatics\nLet me break down the mechanics:\nAl-Qaeda and America been doin' business well\nThey're tighter than Interscope and XXL\nFrom the patriot act to rape in Iraq to\nRussia's war with Afghanistan taking it back to Texas\nGovernor, your state is the most polluted\nAnd you had the most niggas executed\nNow you're born again, alcohol and talking to god\nYeah, dog, I read the book your friends wrote\nInsert the footnotes about how you used to sniff coke\nFrontin' like drug-free role models in harmony\nYour family in florida lives in a pharmacy\nCorporate larceny, tax cuts, that's how you started\nTwelve IQ points from being fuckin' retarded\nSo I gotta represent what I sell, niggas\n(Chorus)\nImpeach the President2Embed"

Motherfucker!\n\n[Verse]\nYeah, 100 percent independent, I'm the fuckin' boss\nI sold 80,000 off a quotable in The Source\nThe hood is not stupid, we know the mathematics\nI made double what I would going gold on Atlantic\nCause EMI, Sony BMG, Interscope\nWould never sign a rapper with the White House in his scope\nThey push pop music like a religion\nAnorexic celebrity driven financial fantasy fiction\nContradiction cause the life we was given resembles life in prison\nFed time with Manuel Noriega\nThe real Noriega, who did America 100 favors\nWith Contras, the Shah and the CIA\nMovin Escobar's coke through the M-I-A\nThis is +The 3rd World+ speakin, through a dead man walkin\nAnd everybody talkin 'bout the South takin over\nIt's true motherfucker, but it's comin over the border\nFuck your chain, my people'll kill you for water\nFuck fans nigga, I got soldier supporters\nThat'll cut your throat if you strapped with a tape recorder\nThat's right motherfucker, welcome to the New World Order\nWhere the truth is always censored by corporate reporters\nThe government, runs the drug politics on the corner\nThat's why I never stress rappers and their employers\nI put a bag over his fuckin head and torture your lawyer\nCause it's too simple to shoot ya - I'll taser the roof of\nYour mouth and electrocute ya, I'll root you out with the Ruger\nThe German Luger, U-boat, and the troops in the scuba\nNigga you can't overthrow me like the island of Cuba!\nNiggas'll never find your body, like the bitch in Aruba\nAnd I maneuver through the state department and their friends\nWith secret deals like the Nazis and IBM\nAnd now you know this ain't a trend or a fashion\nThis is my life and my passion, fuck tryin' to cash in, nigga!\nI need more than advancements and a rented mansion\nSo while you little house niggas is singin' and dancin'\nI'll kill you and take your land like an Israeli expansion\n(\"Invasion\")You might also likeEmbed"

That's just scratchin' the surface!\n[Hook]\nFuck tha Government\nFuck tha Government\nFuck tha Government\nFuck tha Government\n\n[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\nThey say the rebels in Iraq still fight for Saddam\nBut that's bullshit, I'll show you why it's totally wrong\n\u2018Cause if another country invaded the hood tonight\nIt'd be warfare through Harlem and Washington Heights\nI wouldn't be fightin' for Bush or White America's dream\nI'd be fightin' for my people's survival and self-esteem\nI wouldn't fight for racist churches from the South, my nigga\nI'd be fightin' to keep the occupation out, my nigga\nYou ever clock someone who talks shit or look at you wrong?\nImagine if they shot at you and was rapin' your moms\nAnd of course, Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons\nWe sold him that shit after Ronald Reagan's election\nMercenary contractors fightin' a new era\nCorporate military bankin' off the war on terror\nThey controllin' the ghetto with the fear of attack\nTryin' to distract the fact that they engineerin' the crack\nSo I'm strapped, like Lee Malvo, holdin' a sniper rifle\nThese bullets will touch your kids, and I don't mean like Michael\nYour body be sent to the morgue, stripped down and recycled\nI fire on house niggas that support you and like you\n\u2018Cause innocent people get murdered in the struggle daily\nAnd poor people never get shit and struggle daily\nThis ain't no alien conspiracy theory, this shit is real\nWritten on the dollar underneath the Masonic sealYou might also likeEmbed"

I'll leave you laid out in the street\nSigned yours truly, the motherfucking Immortal Technique\n[Outro:]\nYeah, Immortal Technique\nYeah, cut this motherfucker's face offYou might also like2Embed"

Dying\nIs easy, but living with Satan\u2019s gonna be hard.  I spit\nRevolutionary bars that\u2019ll touch ya\nBolshevik status, murder you like the King of Russia\nAnd on your tombstone, chisel \u201cFake Motherfucker\u201d\nCocksucker, I played you \u2018cause I\u2019m the God, but I wouldn\u2019t send\nMy son to save you.  I gave you the pieces to reconstruct\nThe world of the past, but all you could do was ridicule\nThe future and laugh, so I\u2019ma split you in half\nMachine gun to your belly, and then I\u2019ll piss all over your little sister\nLike R. Kelly.  I got more connections than illegals\nSelling microchips to hunt you down after I destroy\nThe mic when I spit.  Immortal Technique, bitch!\nI\u2019m a real lyricist. Other people just use Jay-Z\nAs their ventriloquist.  Now run and tell your boss\nYou motherfucking snitch\n[Verse 2: D. Rymz]\nMost cats\nCan\u2019t remember me because my brain shaking energy\nMentally hitting victims so hard they lose they memory\nAnd generally, you\u2019d rather go to Hell than be my enemy\nYou\u2019re men\u2019ll be with a foot in their chest\u2014there\u2019s the penalty\nDevine\u2019ll mutilate drum beats.  Before I touch\nAn emcee in the cypher, I lubricate the tough piece\nSpin against his Earth \u2018til his reality\u2019s reversed, so when\nHe spits his best verse, it comes out as his worse, so life\nBegins in a hearse and ends it with birth, so everything\nThat he hate, he loves until it hurts\nMy logic is sick.  All you chumps gotta get sticked.  Hot as\nThe clip that was dipped up in the bottomless pit.  With knowledge\nEquipped, I thieve on the foolish.  Reason I knew this:\nJesus and Judas, Caesar and Brutus\nDavid, Goliath, I\u2019m seizing Devine, you heathens are blind\nBe warned: I storm like all four seasons combined\nCarve your extremities like mob in the Genovese\nHeat the part of the brain in charge of the memories\nDudes done forgot how we starved in the \u201870s\nSons continuing wars, our fathers were enemies\nIn these dark spots, the don bomb like the Lebanese\nThe wicked trying to replace God with celebrities\nYeah, you heard me\nThe wicked trying to replace God with celebrities\nYou might also like[Hook: D. Rymz] (x2)\nToo real.  Too fake you\u2019re trying to be\nMy power with words something you ain\u2019t trying to see\nA real lyricist in death, so honor me\nI am what you\u2019re not, I\u2019m an anomalyEmbed"

I don't give a fuck about karma\nCuz if it never comes for those who benefit from misery\nAin't no motherfucking way it could ever do shit to me\nThere's nothing metaphysically deep about getting shot\nPissing in your pants and vomiting blood on tha block\nWitness protection? Try to stay alive on the humble?\nNiggas'll hunt you down like dinosaurs, alive in the jungle\nAnd don't mumble when you try to disrespect my bars\nI'll throw a chinese nigga at you, infected with SARS\nGet banana boat niggas to murder you for a g\nGet'em a green card and getchu chopped up for free\nButchu ain't even worth having your body buried\nIf you was locked up you'd be lap dancing for commissary\nCut the commentary, motherfucker nobody cares\nYou try to go to Thugs Mansion but nobody's there\nBecause the judgement day for you is an empty place\nAnd I'm going to send you first class with a hole in your face\nI'm taking your space nigga, don't act like you know me\nCause i'll fuck your girl whether she likes it or not, like i was Kobe\nI'm Immortal Technique, nigga. You don't want to fuck with that\nI'll beat the shit outta your bitch, and take her trucker hat\nI'm still angry and bitter, got niggas laughing atchu after you die like John RitterYou might also like1Embed"

   "lyrics": "Industrial Revolution (Clean) Lyrics[Intro: Immortal Technique]\nYeah, nigga.  Immortal Technique.  Metaphysics\n\n[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]\nThe bling-bling era was cute but it's about to be done\nI leave you full of clips like the Moon blocking the Sun\nMy metaphors are dirty like herpes but harder to catch\nLike an escape tunnel in prison, I started from scratch\nAnd now these parasites want a percent of my ASCAP\nTrying to control perspective like an acid flashback\nBut here's a quotable for every single record exec\n\"Get your fucking hands out my pocket, nigga!\" like Malcolm X\nBut this ain\u2019t a movie.  I'm not a fan or a groupie and I'm not\nThe type of cat you can afford to miss if you shoot me\nCurse the Heavens and laugh when the sky electrocutes me\nImmortal Technique stuck in your thoughts, darkening dreams\nNo one's as good as me.  They just got better marketing schemes\nI'll lead you to your own destruction like sparking a fiend\n'Cause you got jealousy in your voice like Starscream\nAnd that's the primary reason that I hate y'all faggots\nI've been nice since niggas got killed over 8-ball jackets\nAnd Reebok Pumps that didn't do shit for the sneaker\nI'm a heatseaker with features that'll reach through the speaker\nAnd murder counter-revolutionaries personally\nBreak a thermometer and force-feed his kids mercury\nA&R's tried jerking me, thinking they call shots\nOffered me a deal and a blanket full of smallpox\nYou're all getting shot, you little fucking treacherous bitches!\n[Hook: Immortal Technique]\nThis is the business, and y'all ain\u2019t getting nothing for free\nAnd if you devils play broke, then I'm taking your company\nYou could call it reparations or restitution\nLock and load, nigga.  Industrial revolution\n\n[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\nI want fifty-three million dollars for my calloused hands\nLike the Bush administration gave to the Taliban\nAnd fuck packing grams, nigga.  Learn to speak and behave!\nYou want to spend twenty years as a government slave?\nTwo million people in prison keep the government paid\nStuck in a six by eight cell alive in the grave\nI was made by revolution to speak to the masses\nDeep in the club, toast the truth.  Reach for your glasses\nI'll burn an orphanage just to bring heat to you bastards\nInnocent deep in a casket\u2014Colombian fashion\nIntoxicated off the flow like thug's passion\nYou motherfuckers will never get me to stop blasting\nYou're better off asking Ariel Sharon for compassion\nYou're better off begging for twenty points from a label\nYou're better off battling cancer under telephone cables\nTechnique chemically unstable, set to explode\nForetold by the dead sea scrolls written in code\nSo if your message ain\u2019t shit, fuck the records you sold!\n'Cause if you go platinum, it's got nothing to do with luck\nIt just means that a million people are stupid as fuck\nStuck in the underground, a general that rose to the limit\nWithout distribution managers, a deal, or a gimmick\nRevolutionary Volume 2 murder the critics\nAnd leave your fucking body rotting for the roaches and crickets\nYou might also like[Hook: Immortal Technique]\nThis is the business, and y'all ain\u2019t getting nothing for free\nAnd if you devils play broke, then I'm taking your company\nYou could call it reparations or restitution\nLock and load, nigga.

You see, you are the major purchaser of our national product, which is, of course, coca\u00edna.\"\n\n[Interviewer]\n\"Cocaine. On one hand, you're saying the United States government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the same time, we are doing business with the very same government that is flooding our streets with cocaine?\"\n[Gutierrez]\n\"Mm, mm, si, si. Let me show you a few of the other characters that are involved in this... tragicomedy.\"\n\n[Spanish Dialogue]\n\n\"Oigan ustedes ahi! Ustedes trabajando! Sigan trabajando carajo!\"\n\"Oye Luis, \u00bfCu\u00e1ndo van a terminar?\"\n\"Ahorita.\"\n\"Bueno que se apuren los burros. Ahorita viene el cami\u00f3n, ap\u00fara, diles!\"\n\"Ahorita van a venir para recoger los productos, ap\u00farate!\"\n\n[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]\nI'm on the border of Bolivia, working for pennies\nTreated like a slave, the coca fields have to be ready\nThe spirit of my people is starving, broken and sweaty\nDreaming about revolution (\"\u00a1Revolucion!\") looking at my machete\nBut the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms\nAnd if I ran away, I know they'd probably murder my moms\nSo I pray to Jes\u00fa Cristo when I go to the mission\nProcess the cocaine paste, and play my position\n\n[Verse 2: Pumpkinhead]\nOk, listen, Juan Valdez, just get me my product\nBefore we chop off your hands for worker's misconduct\nI got the power to shoot a copper, and not get charged\nAnd it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad\nSo, to feed your kids? I need these bricks\nForty tons in total, let me test it, indeed, I... [sniffs]\nShit, this is good.  Pass me a tissue\nAnd don't worry about them, I paid off the official\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Diabolic]\nYo, it don't come as a challenge, I'm the son of some of the foulest\nElected by my people, the only one on the ballot\nBorn and bred to consult with feds, I laugh at fate\nAnd assassinate my predecessor to have his place\nIn a third-world fascist state, lock the nation\nWith 90% of the wealth in 10% of the population\nThe Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully\nThe finest type of China white and cocaine, you'll see\n\n[Verse 4: Tonedeff]\nHoney, I'm home!  Never mind why your bank account's suddenly grown.  It's\nFunny we're so out of this debt from this money we owe!  Would you\nRun if I told you that I had two governments overthrown\nTo keep our son enrolled in a private school and to keep our tummies swollen?\nCome on, our fucking home was built on a foundation\nOf bloody throats.  The hungry stolen of their souls.  Of course this country's\nRunning coke.  I took a stunted oath to hush the ones who know\nThe CIA conducts the flow for these young hustlers that lust for dough\n\n[Verse 5: Poison Pen]\nI don't work in the hood.  Hit my connect.  That\u2019s\nWhat's really good.  They supply work to the hood\nThese dudes fucking crack me up.  Scrutinized like\nWe inferior.  Petrified when we meet in my area (Calm down)\nMy dudes don\u2019t shoot until I say so.  You got the loot?\nGive me the \"Yay-Yay!\" like Ice Cube, so don't play with\nMy llello.  We won't stop for you bastards\nMy street scramblers chop it and bag it\n[Verse 6: Loucipher]\nTaking pictures and tapping phones, debating snitches and\nCracking codes.  Fast to cuff or blast the fo' on any\nHustler stacking dough.  There\u2019s probably crack or blow\nAnd my overtime is where your taxes go.  I\u2019ll gain your trust\nGet you to hand weight to us \u2018cause we paid up front\nOn the low with cameras taping ya.  Getting popped\nWith weight?  The prison sentence is due.  Make the call\nAnd then leave with two kis out the evidence room\n\n[Verse 7: C-Rayz Walz]\nWith my fame.  Truck, boat, or plane, they\u2019re watching you\nYou think you got work?  They\u2019re copping too!\nWe control blocks.  They lock countries and own\nCompanies.  We had nice cars and sneaker money!\nNow there's players out there talking 'bout they holding\nWith bugs in their house like they down South with windows open\nYour dough ain't long\u2014you wrong\u2014you take shorts and soon\nFeds\u2019ll be up in your mouth like forks and spoons\nSo enjoy the rush, live plush off coke bread.  Soon\nYou'll be in a cell with me like Jenny Lopez\nIn a school, I was a bully.  Now life is fully a joke\nI\u2019ll keep afloat on a boat for Peruvian coke\nPlayers do favors for governors and tax makers\nFat Quakers smoke crack and sex acts with bad mayors\nThe walls got ears.  You bigmouths probably scared\nNot prepared to do years like Javier [*Prison Cell Shutting*]\n\n[Outro: Immortal Technique]\n\"The story just told is an example of the path that drugs take on their way to every neighborhood, in every state, of this country. It's a lot deeper than the niggas on your block. So when they point the finger at you, brother man? This is what you've got to tell them.\"\n\n[Edited Outro Dialogue from New Jack City, 1991]\n\n[Nino Brown]\n\"I'm not guilty. You're the one that's guilty. The lawmakers, the politicians, the Columbian drug lords... all you who lobby against making drugs legal, just like you did with alcohol during the prohibition! You're the one who's guilty. I mean, c'mon, let's kick the ballistics here: ain't no Uzis made in Harlem! Not one of us in here owns a poppy field! This thing is bigger than Immortal Technique. This is big business. This is the American way.\"Embed"

Do it right\n\n[Immortal Technique]\n\nYo Akir, Talk to \u2018em\n\n[Akir]\n\n(Check)\nI watch the old heads\nReminisce about old bread\nThey wish they would\u2019ve made\nMoney squandered that they could\u2019ve saved\nAt an early age\nDropped out of school; an early grave\nIf they would\u2019ve finished they could\u2019ve got paid a better wage\nWhile their friends chase life faster\nAnd made they way to the lonely grave of the sedaku get plastered\nSees the laughter the blain the lack of perseverance as slackers\nOn the same of the slave masters they hate\nAnd no they never took the time to build their craft up\nLooked for the answers from past us while their life passed them\nHigh off a pipe or ice blastin\u2019\nTo get \u2018em back to a time when they thrived off of bright passion\nI fight like every day is my last one\nI never take my freedom for granted; like the nigga that\u2019s up in them handcuffs\nI methodically kill shit like Manson\nI try to get my money like they holdin\u2019 Grandmas for ransom\n[Hook]\n\nWhat\u2019s mine will come in time\nI\u2019m tired of thinkin\u2019 things will turn out fine\nSo be patient\nWhat\u2019s mine will come in time\nDon\u2019t rush the vision; Things will turn out fine\nBe patient\n\n[Akir]\n\n(Check)\n(Ayo)\nYou see I started off jumpin\u2019 the guns\nStumblin\u2019 tons of mistakes\nBut these are the brakes\nHumble was never fun\nThough taught me to shake it off and re-evaluate\nMy motto was: it\u2019s better to take I\u2019ll fuck around and wait\nI guess its fate\nNone of that dumb hate locks me in gates\nSome say: \u201cLife is a one way and you should try to pace\u201d\nI should\u2019ve listened to Uncle Mike\nCuz he was really right\nHe tried to tip me to what grown man life would be like\nOr Grandfather when he bothered to buy me that bike\nI saw the kids move and I just want to do it I\u2019m like\nWithout fear\nAnd if I lose and fall\nIt\u2019s nothing at all\nHe found it amusing that\u2019s where my dumb ass hit up that wall\nMy pride was hurt but I was more pissed off\nIt\u2019s like an old story\nWhat a repetitive theme\nFrom toddler to teen\nStudent to MC\nI knew where I wanted to be\nI wanted to speed\nThere\u2019s nothing you could tell me\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\nWhat\u2019s mine will come in time\nI\u2019m tired of waitin\u2019; things will turn out fine\nSo be patient\n\n[Immortal Technique]\n\nIf the music\u2019s regarded when I\u2019m dearly departed\nMy life wasn\u2019t what I thought it would be when I started\nWe was broke as a family but when I think back then\nI could determine that\u2019s the wealthiest that I\u2019ve ever been\nChurch flee market apparel, dressed like the cripple child from a Christmas carol\nBut nothing comparable to the avenues that are back in Peru\nPicture a country where people\u2019s dreams never come true\nEven Spanish TV won\u2019t let you see the squalor\nWhite Jesus on the wall but they worship the mighty dollar\nI became a cat burglar, thief, and a robber\nStreet pharmacist vicious rise to Connecticut holler\u2019\nThe cops collared me for the way that I reacted violently\nAnd the prison system made me a slave and a commodity\nBuried underground like prehistoric pottery\nMy life fell apart like families after the lottery\nBut in the hole I wrote a prophecy; I would fulfill\nAnd every year I grow stronger and triple my skill\nAnd even though my cap will be pilled and I will be killed\nAt least it\u2019s for the Revolution and not over krills\nMy willing testament tramples the mind of a pessimist\nTake you back to the prequel before Genesis\nEffortless demeanor like FEMA during Katrina\n\u2018Cuz my flow cannot be locked up like the mind of a dreamer (Yeah)\n[Hook]\n\nWhat\u2019s mine will come in time\n\nI\u2019m tired of wishin\u2019 things will turn out fine\nSo be patient\nWhat\u2019s mine will come in time\nDon\u2019t rush the vision; Things will turn out fine\nBe patient\nFor what\u2019s mine will come in time\nI\u2019m tired of waitin\u2019; things will turn out fine\nSo be patient\nWhat\u2019s mine will come in time\nDon\u2019t rush the vision; Things will turn out fine\nBe patientEmbed"

Arch]\nNow, respect I demand that, do your history\nGive the Indians and Africans they land back\nBustin' my ass while the man stand back for minumun wage?\nNah, I just don't understand that\nMy skill level way beyond collegiate\nCapsize the boat and make the passengers sea sick\nSmooth with that street shit, [?] who I be with\nTaking back what's ours like the peoples of Egypt\nRebel Armz' representer, I pledge my allegiance\nNo matter how I do it, I break through their defense\nFuck a false pretense or sensitive ass meanings\nGermany getting nice on America's current events\nNorth Korea nukes in the morning headlines for the evenings\nWe all cool as fuck, yet, they don't want to see us breathing\nBy the time she on the moon, check to see if they receive it\nMadman militant it's strategic\n\n[Chorus: Immortal Technique]\nWe in the trenches on the offensive\nRunnin' through machine gun fire and barbed wire fences\nMotherfuckers say that violence is senseless\nBut so is getting slaughtered when you caught up defenseless\nWe in the trenches on the offensive\nRunnin' through machine gun fire and barbed wire fences (Rebel Armz)\nLike the Viet Cong back with a vengeance\nYour life is worthless but war is expensive\n[Verse 3: Hasan Salaam]\nThis isn't just drums and rhythm, this is guns and ammunition\nWhen it's sung, redrum for the system\nLet the slugs rumpapum, get it buck when you listen\nAnarchist cookbook, I got the heat in the kitchen\nAct up and wind up using a tube for the pot that you piss in\nSundiata spittin', yeah, I rock for tradition\nI'm a man on a mission like Clarence 13\nOr the great Saladin leading the Mujahideen\nMake moves like Kasparov, with a sawed-off and Molotov\nFlows synonymous with the kickback of a Kalashnikov\nMossberg Upanishads, punishing your promenade\nLike Arch Duke Ferdinand, *BONG* in front your entourage\nRebel Armz firing squad, lugers to bazookas\nMind's balanced with the talents of Larry Davis & Lumumba\nLaying grounds for the future, Cairo on the 25th\nAll power to the people when that 5th Column spitsEmbed"
