The Pharcyde,Otha Fish (The Angel Remix),1993,"Otha Fish (The Angel Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Bootie Brown, SlimKid3]|Yeah, bam, bam, bam, hey, hey, what's up? Yeah|We was like that, you know|Yeah, and I now just got laid back|Yeah, I'ma, uh, I'ma just sit in here for a couple of hours|Man||[Verse 1: SlimKid3]|It took a second to register up in my branium|My dome, my head, my skull, my cranium|My eyes have had enough, it was time to do some talking|I had to creep through the hound-dogs that were stalking|This slimmy caught me peeping|This means she wasn't sleeping on who I was|So she creeped in like a hawk|In a minute's time, we adjourned to the floor|Ooh! I hit a high note 'cause of the way that she was walking|We got into the groovе, I didn't bust no, uh, hip-hop moves|I just kept it nice and smooth|Nеxt thing you know, we got together, word, I thought we'd be forever|Didn't have an umbrella, now I'm soaked in stormy weather|Whether two birds of a feather fly or fall it'll be together|Never simp, pimp, and leave your love life limp|There'll be no suicide attempts for this slim-trim kid|'Cause you know there's other fish in the sea, that is, in the sea|In the sea that is|[Refrain: SlimKid3]|You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is||[Verse 2: SlimKid3]|I reminisce, try to clear up all the myths|For an imaginary kiss with you again|Not even friends, though I wish that I could mend|Like a tailor and be Olive Oyl's number one sailor|I ams what I am, still I falls like an anvil|She's heavy on the mind, sometimes it's more than I can handle|But men aren't supposed to tumble into the den, B|Macho, but a honcho like Pancho will give in|Family oriented, but not Oriental|A dame is supposed to claim ya even if you drive a Pinto|A hero is a sandwich, and a Manwich is a meal|A marriage is a paper; are they fakin' or for real?|What's the deal, dabbers? Will you go tumbling after|Your man and take a stand or will you help him roll faster?|The reason why I ask you is because I'm sick of this|Bitch licking drip drip from a nigga's benefits|He doesn't even suit you and he's surely not your size|I'm surprised that you slept on a heart that's worldwide|And when ya open up your eyes, babe, my mate, I really wish|That you don't bruise a limb as you swim with other fish in the sea|In the sea that is|You might also like[Chorus: SlimKid3, The Pharcyde]|You know there's other fish in the sea, that is|In the sea, in the sea, that is, in the sea|You know there's other fish in the sea, that is||[Verse 3: SlimKid3]|Now, if there ain't no mountain high enough|Why ain't you climbing up?|My hand has been extended ever since the day I lent it to ya|I thought I knew ya, but I didn't even know ya|Bro, you're stupid, 'cause you thought you captured Cupid|And you found that love ain't two bits of shit|So I resign and quit|It ain't even about the hips, or the lips or the tits or|Even the pussy whip, Elizabeth, this is it|Because I slipped and I tripped into a shoe that didn't fit|And now the next man is stealing my heart away|I'd charge him like a bull, but his pull never fades me|The kid is going crazy, they stepping with my lady|They're working on a baby, I'm pushing up the daisies, but|Hey diddle diddle, I won't play second fiddle|To no man and stand firm on this|And seal up on the bliss with a big juicy kiss|Just call me Big Gibraltar, miss|No, I won't diss, I'm just like off to other fish in the sea|[Outro: Slimkid3, The Pharcyde]|(Once again) In the sea, that is, in the sea|(Once again) In the sea, that is|In the sea, baby|Now you know there's other fish that's in the sea|Now you know there's other fish that's in the sea|In the sea, baby; in the sea, baby|In the sea, baby; in the sea, baby|In the sea, baby; in the sea, baby|In the sea, baby; in the sea, baby|In the sea, baby|(You know there's other fish that's in the sea)|In the sea, baby|(You know there's other fish that's in the sea)|In the sea, baby|(You know there's other fish that's in the sea)|In the sea, baby|(You know there's other fish that's in the sea)|In the sea, baby|(You know there's other fish that's in the sea)|In the sea, baby|(You know there's other fish that's in the sea)|In the sea, baby|(You know there's other fish that's in the sea)|In the sea, baby||You know there's other fish that's in the sea|You know there's other fish that's in the sea|You know there's other fish that's in the sea|You know there's other fish that's in the seaEmbed"
