So enjoy the days you have. Worry not about the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death.

him a cracker|Identifying as black, looking as white|Being told what you can or can’t be|This kid went through everything|He went through...|He saw narcotics in the household|Violence, murderers, drug

nothin', nothin'|Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing|And I, and he, he said fuck that, I’ma persevere|And that’s why the message is always peace, love and positivity|See, he always saw things from two sides|He always saw things from two sides|He always knew that the message|Everybody was born equal|Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation|He knew that because he saw that|(Take it back, take it way back|Take it way)|Because he was stripped and torn down|By his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated|And that did not know|And he was stripped and he was torn down|By his white side that did not know|These people that are ignorant|That cannot see the bigger picture|That must fight and kill and murder each other|But once again, all he ever wanted to do|Was spread a message of equality|For every man, woman, and child|Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation|(Take it back, take it way back|Take it way, way back to the first)|Now imagine this child growing up|And seeing the craziest shit|Being a part of the craziest shit|Running around with the wrong people|Running around with guns and knives|And fighting and stealing and, and all this|Because he didn’t know, he didn’t know!|But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn’t right|And he knew that he needed to get away from it|Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old|This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself|Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings|And then he would then come home|To about eight or nine hours of sleep|But spend four, five, six hours of that|Working on music, persevering|Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror|And pretending to see thousands and thousands

back|Take it way, way back to the first black)|And that man is here today, proud|A lover of all human beings|Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah|And he’s here to say:|Even though we’re all born and created equal|We are not treated equally|There’s extremists on every side|And you should just do your best to live life|And let other people believe whatever they

Hollywood|I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars|When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic|As my body began to fade|In this moment my mind was full of clarity|But my body insisted it was in danger|I looked around and I told myself I was safe, I was fine|But I was convinced that something was wrong|Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to|Fall and fade away|My body grew weak|And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety|I refused to believe this story|I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me|I began to feel detached from reality|I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass|I got blood work done|Analysis of my mind and body to no avail|The doctor said it was anxiety|But how could it be anxiety?|How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?|How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death?|Derealization|The sense of being out of one’s body|I’m not here|I’m not me|I’m not real|Nothing is|Nothing but this feeling of panic|Nobody understands|Nobody knows the sufferings|This physical feeling|It can’t be anxiety|It can’t|Or can it?|Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body?|Yeah, of course|I’m so in control of my mind and my body|But I’m subconsciously forcing myself into a state|Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind|I am unhappy|Not with life|But with this feeling|I am scared, I am human, I am a man|But I look in the mirror and I see a child|I am an adult who recognize grown ups don’t really know shit|And they never did|And it scares me|Cause now I’m just a grown up who doesn’t know shit|But one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me|No, no this feeling|This anxiety is nothing|I have anxiety|Just like you, the person I wrote this for|And together we will overcome this feeling|We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge|That we are alive|And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted|We will rejoice in this gift that is life|We will rejoice in this day that we have been given|We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves|Starting with mental health|We will accept ourselves as we are|And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror|We will accept ourselves|And live with anxiety32Embed"

we're gonna bring up to the stage usually does not come in on Monday nights|You're in for a real treat, ladies and gentlemen|Give it to Mr. Hall||[Verse 1]|Rip out my soul from the depths of my flesh|Flesh from my blood I caress|Right on the page so it's fresh|I take my time, but express|Lot on my mind, but I guess|It's just in my genes like a Glock 17, like a genetic scene|Kick in the door, we blow it off the hinge|Music my drug, tie it off, then inject the syringe|It's in my blood, ain't no need to pretend|Therapist tell me I don't need to defend|Therapy tell me I don't need to explain|Just drop the record on the needle and express my pain|Can't wait until my son shine and together we reign|My queen's by my side like Manhattan|Fuck rapping, this is poetic conviction|My rendition is not meant for your diction|Battled addiction in the womb|A crack baby by definition|Keys to ignition with no permission|That mean that I'm driven|Alive 'cause I'm living|Fuck workin' with what you've been given|I knew I always wanted more like The Roots in nine-five|And I'll be sure to do more for my family than mine did|'Cause hip-hop rhymes taught me more than my moms did|Didn't drink 'til I was twenty-five 'cause I'm my mom's kid|All I knew was alcoholism and prison|Only saw domestic violence and racial division|Social worker trying to take me away|But I know that group home probably worse, hell nah, no way|At least I know my odds here, I'ma be okay|Adapted to the lifestyle, so I'ma be okay|[Interlude]|Keep that one just in case, yeah||[Verse 2]|I'm just an entity|My DNA, not my identity|Finding serenity|Become a better man, I better be|For the child in my baby mama stummy, never crummy|We get big bread|Tryin' to be the greatest, that shit been dead|I'm trying to be the happiest that I can be instead|I'm trying to get ahead like a fetus|Money don't complete us, but it feed us, it can lead us to depression|Being rich is not a blessing, fame is not a blessing|Wasn't 'til I was rich and famous, I learned that lesson|What's the meaning of life, to live it, what I'm guessing||[Verse 3]|Live it, live it|Living life like this is so crazy|Hip-hop is amazing|One day, you're on top and the next, they want to erase 'em|Goddamn, what I'm facing|Every day a new frustration|People thinking I'm complacent|People thinking that I changed like a cashier|But I can't let that register, get the fuck up on out of here|Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, get high as the stratosphere|I can hear the voices in my mind when I rhyme|Give it up, you're out of time|Never even had a prime|Like the Preemo never linked up with 5'9""|Bitch, I'm back like the muscles surrounding my vertebrae|Okay, fuck what you gotta say|I keep it going, already know when I'm flowing|For the listener, you're kind of like a therapist|Or rather Cole in 2005, flowing like Canibus|That throwback shit, yeah, that throwback shit|Fuck what you heard, my catalog, it ain't got no wack shit|'Cause I'm a gladiator in the Colosseum, everybody wanna be him|'Til they feel like they can't be him, then they wanna see him lose|Wrote this poem in navy, that's what I call singing the blues|Word to Dot D, my family got me, no carbon copy|Life can hit you harder than Drago|But if I roll with the punches when it's rocky, don't ever stop me|Never top me, never cocky, I'm never cocky|Okay, well, maybe sometimes|Occasionally in some rhymes|But it's fine, in due time|I'm the illest to ever do it, come now, Bobby Boy, cool it|An indigenous era of the indigenous emcee|Riding

childhood|Bringing a baby in this world, I hope my child good|All I ever gave a fuck about was my career|But all that shit out the window now that my son is here|Fuck sales and streams, none of that shit entails dreams|Fuck rap, fuck press, fuck feeling like I'm less|If it ain't 'bout my happiness, then I could give a fuck less|I remember window shopping|Now I'm shopping for windows for my baby new room|Bobby coming soon|And that's the type of line I would've second-guessed|Putting on my shit before|Out of fear that they would hate 'cause they couldn't relate|'Cause it wasn't relevant|Give a fuck if it's evident, this right here is the evidence|I'm like Leo in Revenant, bear with me|You could tear me apart|But that won't take away the fact I wrote this shit from the heart|Where it's built from the start|Where it's finna stay|I've learned every day's a good day|Surrounded by people that love me|Don't want nothing from me but my happiness|Off the internet, that's when I'm at my happiest|Scrolling so much, my thumb fucked up|We call that carpal tunnel vision|Follow me like religion on this course of collision|Feeling imprisoned, and this is my freedom through these lyrics|As I repeat them and beat 'em into my conscience like Adonis|All this lyricism straight to the dome like cocaine through the sinus|I think I finally found my paradise, that's word to Thomas52Embed"

Logic,Obediently Yours,2020,"Obediently Yours Lyrics[Interlude: Orson Welles and Logic]|This is Logic|I've spoken these words before but not on the radio|To be born free is to be born in debt|To live in freedom without fighting slavery|To profiteer|I have met Southerners who expect and fear a Negro insurrection|I see no purpose in withholding this from general discussion|There may be those within that outcast ten percent of the American people who someday will strike back at their oppressors|But to put down that mob, a mob would rise|I'd like to ask, please: who will put down that mob?|I'm an overpaid producer with pleasant reasons to rejoice, and I do|In the wholesome practicability of the profit system|But surely, my right to having more than enough is cancelled|If I don't use that more to help those who have less|I owe the very profit I make to the people I make it from|If this is radicalism, it comes automatically to most of us in show business|It being generally agreed that any public man owes his position to the public|That's what I mean when I say I'm your obedient servant|We must, each day, earn what we own|A healthy man owes to the sick all that he can do for them|An educated man owes to the ignorant all that he can do for them|A free man owes to the world's slaves all that he can do for them|And what is to be done is more, much more, than good works|Christmas baskets, bonuses and tips, and bread and circuses|There is only one thing to be done with slaves|Free them|If we can't die in behalf of progress, we can live for it|Progress, we Americans take to mean, a fuller realization of democracy|The measure of progress, as we understand it, is the measure of equality enjoyed by all men|We can do something about that|The way our fighting brothers and sisters looked at it|Some of them dead as I speak these words|The way they looked at it, we're lucky|And they're right, we're lucky to be alive|But only if our lives make life itself worth dying for|We must be worthy of our luck or we are damned|Our lives were spared, but this is merely the silliest of accidents|Unless we put the gift of life to the hard employments of justice|If we waste that gift, we won't have anywhere to hide from the indignation of history|I want to say this|The morality of the auction block is out of date|There is no room in the American century for Jim Crow|Tomorrow's democracy discriminates against discrimination|Its charter won't include the freedom to end freedom|Race hate isn't human nature, race hate is the abandonment of human nature|But this is true|There are alibis for the phenomenal excuses, economic and social|But the brutal fact is simply this|Where the racist lies acceptable, there is corruption|The race haters must be stopped, the lynchings must be stopped|The murders must be avenged|I come in that boy's name and in the name of all, who, in this land of ours, have no voice of their own|I come with a call for action|This is the time for it|I call for action against the cause of riot|It won't surprise me if I'm accused in some quarters of inciting to riot|Well, I'm very interested in riots, I'm very interested in avoiding them|So I call for action against the cause of riots|Law is the best action, the most decisive|It's in the people's power to see to it that what makes lynchings and starts wars is dealt with|Not by well-wishers, but by policemen, and I mean good policemen|Over several generations, maybe there'll be men who can't be weaned away from the fascist vices of race hate|But we should deny such men responsibility in public affairs|Exactly as we deny responsibility to the wretched victims of the drug habit|There are laws against peddling dope|There can be laws against peddling race hate|But every man has the right to his own opinion as an American boasts|But race hate is not an opinion, it's a phobia|It isn't a viewpoint, race hate is a disease|In a people's world, the incurable racist has no rights|He must be deprived of influence in a people's government|He must be segregated, as he himself would segregate the colored and semitic peoples|Anything very big is very simple|If there's a big race question, there's a big answer to it|And a big answer is simple, like the word ""no""|America can write her name across this century, and so she will|If we, the people, brown and black and red|Rise now to the great occasion of our brotherhood|It will take courage|It calls for the doing of great deeds, which means the dreaming of great dreams|Giving the world back to its inhabitants is too big a job for the merely practical|No one of us will live to see a blameless peace|We strive and pray and die for what will be here when we're gone|Our children's children are the ancestors of a free people|To the generations: the fight is worth it|And that just about means that my time is up|When my time's up, I remain as always, obediently yours|Arjun IvaturyYou might also like21Embed"

It's gon- It's the come up. It's the glow up. It's what we've always wanted||[Logic]|Uh, Well the message for the music is just equality of man. Straight up. Straight up and down. 6 o'clock. When white people find out that I'm black, racist white people. They treat me on some like-and I've heard this, ""Send your ass back to Africa, or at least the half that doesn't matter."" Shit like that, that I've heard. It's like that's what I am, I'm either one or the other to these people. There's like just a handful, no more than I think like 4 songs, where I am truly discussing being biracial in America. With that being said, Those are the only times I discuss race, and it's my race. Not your race or his race or her race, It's just me being biracial and telling my story. And you might not like my story, but it's my story|You know, and then the entire rest of the album is rapped, you know, from different perspectives of a life that that dude Atom, who is being reincarnated has lived||[Logic In The Studio With Groups Of People]|There's a guy who dies in the beginning of this album and his name is Atom. Atom but like the ""first man"" right? But spelled A-T-O-M, like the atoms in our body and everything connecting us. He gets hit by a car and wakes up in a white void. And he's talking to this random guy. And the guy's like ""Life, What's it all about?"" And he's like ""What? What the fuck you talkin' about?"" He's like ""Where am I?"" Well, it turns out the random guy is actually God. Have you ever heard of this guy named Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Scientist, scientist, astrophysicist, crazy, super awesome, and I don't know how the hell I did it, but I got him to play the role of God on my album. Which is crazy||[Logic On His Couch]|I can't even believe that Neil DeGrasse Tyson is on this album. Like when I think about it, that's like the most gangster feature of all time||[Logic and Neil Recording]|Logic: So what now, what advice can you give me?|Neil: What advice can I give humanity?|You might also like[Logic And Friends In The Studio]|You guys know Big Von? He's like the radio DJ from the bay, on KMEL||[Steve Wyreman]|Oh Yeah||[Logic]|So he plays this guy named Atom||[Big Von and Logic Recording]|Big Von: Wait, wait, wait, what? Stop all the hippie shit||[Logic Explaining Concept]|This guy Atom dies and it's a whole conversation between them. And he finds out that he is about to be reincarnated. And then he finds out that not only that is he being reincarnated, but that he is everybody who has ever been reincarnated because there is only one human being. And he has been reincarnated so many times, in fact, that he is every human being that has ever existed. You know he was Jesus and all of his disciples. He was Hitler and everybody that he murdered. You know, every time he extended a hand of kindness to someone, he was doing it to himself. Every time he was extending a hand of hatred or murder to someone, he was only doing it onto himself. And it isn't until he has lived in the shoes of ever man, woman, child, race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation that he will know what it is to appreciate life and then be taken to the next plane of existence. So every time I'm rapping on the album pretty much, I'm rapping from the perspectives of one of the lives he has lived. So it's very sci-fi, but it's very real at the same time. It's weird man, it's a good one||[No I.D.]|Hip-Hop artists are tasked to not have any imagination, but to actually work in direct correlation to where they are from, who they were, and you know he has a lot of imagination||[Logic In His House]|I was actually really inspired when I read a short story that was written by a writer by the name of Andy Weir called ""The Egg."" I read it and it inspired me so much, and it's essentially the same thing, it's just my take on it. You know, it's a man who dies and is reincarnated and lives every life ever. And I thought ""wow,"" I relate to more than just one sect or one side of humanity or race being biracial. I kind of feel that. I feel kind of what what it's like to be two people. To be like a black man in a fair skinned body, if that makes any sense. So it's like wow, it's almost like living two separate lives to the public. Not to me, but to others.  They might view me as different people. I guess wow, that's crazy I never really thought of it like that||[No I.D.]|So bringing who he is into the stories that he wants to tell and having them intertwine with reality and fantasy, sci-fi, That's the difficult thing to score||[Logic]|I didn't think I was going to be able to pull it off. I mean how do you pull off that? How do you pull off an album rapping from different perspectives of a life that one man lived, who is actually everyone ever. it's just crazy, but I don't know how the hell it came together, but it did|[Hallelujah Interlude]||[Logic Outside His House]|This is so much more than just music. It's like a true personal part of my life. So, I'm getting my license, I'm doing my best to get fit and in shape, and deal with being mentally healthy and physically healthy. And dealing with my music and friends, wife, personal relationship, and dogs and everything. So I just want you guys to see as much of my life as you can see||[Logic Driving]|So yesterday, I think i was telling Mike that I had the wildest anxiety ever. In my mind I was like, I'm like ""I'm fine, I'm fine"" I don't know why but I was feeling physically weird. Not like ill or anything, just like- faint. You know kind of dizzy, kind of out of it. Very disconnected||[Fan Recognizes Logic]|Fan: Logic?|Logic: 'Sup dude?|Fan: What's going on man, how's you day?|Logic: Nice, I got an appointment. What's your name man?|Fan: Raymond|Logic: *Shakes his hand* Nice to meet you Raymond|Raymond: You have a great day|Logic: Thanks brother||[Logic]|Yeah, that's a big thing that I've been dealing with so much, which is like anxiety. A lot of people don't understand it and that's why I'm like having you document this right now because I want to invite everybody into my life like never before and I have severe anxiety and it's hard and it sucks||[Logic Making Beats]||[Logic]|It's just so crazy because I've always-like I'm on my shit you know what I mean? Like I'm on my shit and I know what I need to do and how I need to do things But then anxiety can step in and be like ""you feel up to having this meeting or this conversation or going on stage or performing or this or that, But I'm gonna fuck you up."" Like it's weird, it's crazy and so anxiety is so much more than just mental. it's a mental thing that can affect you physically and that's why when I had the biggest panic attack I ever had last year, you know just after The Incredible True Story was made, I was convinced I was going through was a physical thing. I was convinced it was something deeper like it was fucking cancer. Like, you know what I mean? Cause my body was so fucked up and um, it's not that. It's my mind. It's anxiety||[Making of Anziety]||[Lucy Rose]|When I went in the booth and I knew all of you guys were all out there listening, and I was learning it there and then on the spot, what he wanted me to sing. Damn, my legs were shaking, I was so nervous, It was the first time I sung it and I guess that’s when you really-like I realized that he's got a vision and I have to trust it because I wanted to practice it and get better at it, he comes back in and I was like I wanna know, I want to capture how you are right now when you're singing this for the first time||[Logic]|I think that's good, ah!||[Rose]|The first time in my life I have done anything like that||[Logic]|You never?||[Lucy Rose]|I'm not really sure how it goes||[Lucy Rose Back Outside]|Now listening back i really understand why he wanted to do that cause there was a vulnerability to what was captured that i don't know if that would have been the same if I had learnt it||[Logic and Lucy In The Booth]||[Logic Recording ""Anziety""]||[Logic]|Yo, making music makes me feel good man. Like when I'm here with you guys, like not to sound any type of way, a lot of that,I mean I still be feelin' weird, but a lot of it goes away. It's like I have purpose with you guys||[Logic Four Days Later]|Hold on, I'm trying to think... one sec'. Should it end with the hook? Or maybe-maybe that's not the hook. Maybe I keep going right now and then I bring the hook again... that's what I'll do, I will extend this verse...||[Records Rest Of ""Anziety""]||It's always really hard to recreate a vibe, because I was in such a zone the other night. I have to tap back into that same energy. It's gotta be the same||[Records More Of ""Anziety""]||Alright, NO NO. Can you pause it? I fucking hate technology. Pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it... alright can you run it back with the last shit i was doing? My fucking- my phone deleted all the shit. Fucking hate this shit||I think this is harder than when I did ""Gang Related.""||[Continues]||Let me hear that... Woo!||[Logic to Bart Simpson figure]|So I need you to bring it back so it sounds really good, you know? You gotta make it like, you gotta make my vocals pop, period. Like I'm going here and this breaks, like you gotta feel it in your soul. As the Engineer you need to know what you're doing. [Anziety bass boosted] You know what I'm saying? Gotta be really good||[Bobby Campbell]|I lost my job to Bart Simpson?||[Logic]|Yeah, you're fucking out bro||(Driving)|I was with No I.D. yesterday, Haden't seen him for a while. And we just had a real good talk. Man to man, shot some pool||[No I.D]|We shoot pool, and I just want it know I won 3 games today. (Camera man: he's gonna edit that out) it doesn't matter... WHEN YOU EDIT THIS JUST KNOW... 3-0||[Logic]|Just out of nowhere, then I played him my album. And he loved it||[No I.D.]|My thoughts were just by far his best work, for me||[Logic]|And I asked him to rap on it, and he said yeah||[No I.D.]|I mean, I can- I can rap||[Logic]|No I.D. is going to rap on my album. Which is like, what, that's so unheard of||[No I.D.]|I haven't really recorded a song in 20 years||[Logic]|I texted J. Cole and I was like, ""Yo, Deon's rapping on my album, No I.D.,"" and he was like ""WHAT? How the fuck did you get him to do that?"" and I thought about it, and I just asked him. ""Only you could get him to do that""||I've waited for this moment my whole life. Right now, nothing else matters. Just making music here with Deon||[Making of America]|The concept is how we're all and what's going on in the Native American community that's being ignored||[America Interlude]||[Logic]|America, so America came together, you all were there. That shit was crazy. I just found these like sample packs or like little things and like vocals and I was pressing them, and I was throwing drums on, and creating the pads||[Production of America beat]||When I create music I hear sounds. Distinct-- That's why you can hear my shit when you got to festivals or whatever. They sing all the words because it's catchy. All the sounds are catchy. First things you hear, Woo... that's the ""ohhhh "" and it goes off||You'll hear a switch up and then I'm just rapping from like a hood motherfucker and that's all he knows. And like, that's a lot of my own experience like with my brothers, and then my boy Lenny is like helping me voice this, you'll hear it||[Big Lenbo in the booth]||[Lenny]|When Logic approached me with the contributing to the song ""America"" he laid it out. He knew what he wanted so he gave me the inspiration. Told me exactly what he was going for in that part of the song||[No I.D.]|We worked on the first album, and I was the Executive Producer. And some of the first session into the album I pretty much knew he was a producer, not just a rapper. I told him ""hey, you don't really need me to produce your records, because you have your ideas. You need to you know have access to the personnel and techniques to deliver your thoughts.""||[Bobby Campbell]|The first album was 6ix and Logic, the exact same way they did it on the mixtapes. Like nothing has changed from that you know. These two guys, sitting in the house, not the big studio, not even down here, not anywhere special. Just the two of them sitting down with the laptop, a concept, and some kind of inspiration||[6ix]|What's crazy too is you know, the same process we were doing back in the day. Like , we didn't have the string players, we didn't have the vocalists with us. That's what's so crazy about it is, the process is the same, but now we get to involve actual real musicians, rather than me tryna sample a string part from another song because I can't play it. But now I can be like, we have Claire and Tom to actually play the shit||[Lenbo]|Big Von, he just gets really entertaining||[Big Von recording skits]||[Big Von]|Got Neil on the album, you know how crazy that is? Space, Time, all the good things like that.  Man, Logic has come up with the crazy story of all stories||[Logic to Damian Lemar Hudson]|So I was in Paris, with my wife, at the Louvre||[Sam Spratt]|So, it all started last summer when I get a call from Bob. And I pick up the phone, and It's three in the morning, and I say ""Bob, what's up man, what the fuck is this?"" And he's like ""I'm in Paris man, I'm at the Louvre, and I know what our album is going to be.""||[Logic]|Everybody is looking at the Mona Lisa, and I'm looking at the Mona Lisa like ""Wow, Leonardo Da Vinci painted this shit. Woah, this is crazy.""|But then I'm looking at, myself included, everyone is so focused on the Mona Lisa, I'm in this insane museum with all this beautiful statues and paintings and all different types of stuff. So I was like ""I'm gonna go look for something else"", not just focus on this. And I turn around, and as soon as I turn around I see this||This is The Wedding at Cana. It was when Jesus turned water into wine||[Sam Spratt]|I'm like ""Dude, doesn't that have like a hundred people in it?"" and he's like ""Yeah, it has like over 100 people. I don't know if we need that many, but like close. I want you to paint all of it. I want all my friends, all my family, everyone who works on this albums, people of all races, colors, creeds, sexual orientations, and genders. I wasn't it to be representative of Everybody.""||Early into the year I decided I wanted to go to Italy to get inspiration for this. I did my research online, went through Google image search, and I studied countless books about the artist himself, other artists in the period, but there's limits to that. there was something about it where I felt compelled-- I always wanted to go to Italy. if there was ever a chance, why not now?||I went to every possible church I could, I went to the museum, I saw the Caravaggio, I immersed myself in everything I've loved and researched and I brought it back and put everything into the cover||[Logic]|This is going to be my album cover||[Sam Spratt]|The album is told from a variety of perspectives, which is something Bob loves to do. Putting himself in someone else's shoes and taking on their struggles and success, trying to see things through their perspective. This album, listening to it, sonically connects you to the art. it just executes that flawlessly||[Logic] For the longest time, I just wanted to focus on the music and not talk about race or negative shit going on in the world because I wanted it to be happy and fun, and about lyricism and raw shit. I felt that i needed to make and album like this because me being black & white and feeling discriminated against by my own people, made me feel like I need to talk about everyone else who was discriminated against||I didn't wanna be like ""I'm biracial, but I look white and blah blah blah, no I'm really gonna talk about not only what's on my heart and mind, but whats on the hearts and minds of people all over the world who don't have the voice that I do||I am here with Patrick Starr in my studio. And I recruited him because he's amazing and awesome and he's a very sweet, kind person, and an amazing business man-- Or business queen. No, but honestly, he's just been so awesome and he's just such a great role model for so many people I wanted to include him as a representative for his culture and just have him on the album and album cover||[Starr]|Thank you! This is dope, so dope||[Logic]|I appreciate it, Thank you||[Patrick Starr in the booth]||[Logic]|I see good people who like to make good music and it's just that simple. Like ""Hey, do you like what I'm doing? Do you like what I stand for? Oh you like this message? you wanna come play? You wanna be a part of it? Yes or No?""||So I'm flying this woman out, from the Bahamas, where me and my wife went on our anniversary. Her name is Paula||[Paula McKeva]|Hiii, I'm Paula McKeva, all the was from [?], Bahamas. Met Bobby, known as Logic as well, in the Atlantis resort and Casino Hotel||[Logic]|We were at the bar having a few drinks and this shit was killing it||[McKeva]|I was singing Uptown Funk, so everyone was on the floor having fun||[Logic]|I was like up, and I was dancing with like all these older ladies and shit. It was like so fun||But like she KILLED it. Her voice was like killing it. She was doing like Whitney Houston songs and shit||[McKeva]|I told him to come on the stage and said ""Show me what you got."" Then he went WILD and crazy. I didn't know who he was||[Logic]|After dinner, and she went to take a little break, I asked her if she wanted to come sing on my album, and she said ""yeah.""||[McKeva in the booth]||[Kev Randolph playing around on the keys]||[Bobby Campbell]|Kev, I love what you're doing, but we're gonna mute that sound||[Killing Spree Interlude]||[Booth Harmonizing]||[Confess plays]||[Logic crying]|I just had this crazy cry because I'm happy though. And I'm not trying to milk anything, but I thought I should let you know. I just wanted to in this moment-- Let you know I was listening to this song, ""Anziety"" and just thinking about how hard it is to live with it. But beyond that, the song, it made me realize how many people are here. How many people are in this house. And how blessed I am to have my wife and my dogs  and my friends and music and fans. I can't believe it. Because I didn't have anything growing up, I didn't have anything. And now I have everything I could have ever wanted. And just right now in this moment I am so happy and blessed. Sorry, I just wanted to real quick-- I'm not trying to milk it or anything. I just wanted to say that, that i can't believe it's all real and happening||[1-800-273-8255 producing]||[Khalid in the booth]||[Logic] We're at Warner Bros. We are at the soundstage where they do all the scoring for films, and we are doing the album. And I'm excited, I feel like I don't belong here||(to the orchestra)|I just wanted to say this is fucking crazy. Like, I'm sorry, this is just crazy and I know we're here to work but like I came from nothing-- so to be able to be here today is a very emotional thing. And this album is about the equality of man regardless of race, religion, color, creed and sexual orientation. This is the fight for equality||[Orchestra plays]||[6ix]|Yo, Bob, you know what's really crazy? Making a beat on Ableton of FL Studio and then like seeing that shit charted out and noted. That's amazing, isn't that like crazy||[Logic]|Yeah, we're just like Neanderthals||(Laughing)||[6ix]|Like all the sheet music, but like what we sample||[Orchestra plays]||[Bobby Hall (Logic's dad)]|My name is Bobby ""Smokey"" Hall, I'm legend. I'm the legend of hip-hop go-go. I'm here to see my son, Logic, one of the hypest artists out there. He's just in his own zone. He's got a string session going on right now. [?] so yeah, I love him||[Logic conducts the orchestra]||[Logic]|It's been an amazing experience, and I really appreciate it (Crying)||[Bobby Hall]|Bobby has always been driven, even as a kid. He was a leader, not a follower. He never followed, you know what I'm saying? he had his own way that he lived||I took Bobby in the recording studio when he was like 15 for the first time. And he spit for like 45 minutes, non-stop. The engineer and I, Rock, just laughed and said ""That boy got bars.""||[Lucy Rose]|You were talking to your mates last night on the sofa and I was just like listening in and trying to learn what you guys were talking about. And you were saying like ""We work with loads of people, but we FUCK with Logic."" And I was like... excuse me? You were like ""You know what I'm saying,  we FUCK with Logic. We FUCK with him you know what I'm saying?"" And I'm like what are you talking about? I had no idea what that meant||[Logic]|So when did that click for you what that meant?||[Lucy Rose]|Oh, only like 24 hours later, when I asked what it was. Did I ask one of you guys? I was like ""What does that mean when you fuck with someone?"" I thought if you're fucking with someone, you're fucking them up or something||(Laughing)||[Logic]|This is a classic documentary moment right here||[Who?]|Lucy, I got a better one for you. You ever heard of what a fuckboy is?||[Lucy Rose]|So yeah, that, Jess said, before she met you, ""I wen't out with a couple of fuckboys"" and I was like is that just some one like, you have sex with?||(Laughing)||She said that just means like a lame person||Well, I fuck with Logic||[Logic]|Yeah, we fuck with you Lucy Rose||[Lucy Rose]|I fuck with you all||[Logic]|We fuck with you||(Laughing)||[Logic]|It was a long-ass time ago, I'm in the studio with this mo-fucker and he brings this in|And I'm like ""Dillon what's that?"" And he's like ""its that P1 bro, for sure.""  And I'm like ""damn that's crazy, thats so cool"", he's like ""yeah man check it out"", doing all this shit and I'm like oh my god, I gotta have this||So i hopped in the whip, I go, I drop the bread on this shit immediately, and all I get out of it , like used it for. I spent all that money, and  got the kick for ""Like Woah"", and it's worth every penny||[Sir Dylan and 6ix working on Ink Blot]||[Logic]|This is rapped from the perspective of a rapper that like, the first half, it almost sounds like a sample with the vocals, but it's all myself. And he's saying like "" I don't want to sleep all day and get up at night"" like eh's not happy with  the life that he's living because he's one of those rappers focussing on money and material possessions||It's called ""Ink Blot"" because one of the line is ""I'm not me, I'm who you want me to be."" And he's rapping like ""yeah I got this money and I'm not a real rapper it's all bullshit, I'm making my money, fuck it.""||Like that personification of that rapper like that tone, chain wearing, ""yeah yeah I rap"", but deep down he's not happy, but his raps are like yeah I got this and millions. it's just a rapper who isn't happy with himself, but is making a lot of money. So that's the song|[Juciy J & Logic recording Ink Blot]|Perpetratin' ass, dumb ass mothafuckas, man|All on the 'Gram, all on the Snapchat with the bullshit|Kill yo' mothafuckin self, nigga|Kill yo' mothafuckin self, nigga|And tell yo' bitch I said slob on my knob|That’s crazy!|Yo, I’ma keep all this shit for the album|Oh they gon' love that, they gon' be like, ""Aw fuck""||[Logic]|So, we're here, on Scotch Wednesday, it's a little thing I do with my buddies. Every Wednesday, as grown men, we drink scotch, shoot pool, play some jazz and Sinatra on vinyl over there. (cheers)||[Camera man to Logic]|Did you smoke a Jefferey?||[Logic (rubbing the wall)]|Freefalllll||[Logic]|Woah wait, who has some other really good ones you can impersonate? Like Sinatra... OH give me Tonight Show All hand on deck, go||(All hands on deck)||Keep going||[Jessica]|You're gonna do great. (Kiss) ... you just totally left me hanging||[Logic]|Oh, sorry||[Driving instructor]|Hello, sir, how are you doing today?||[Logic]|I'm doing good, how are you doing?||[Instructor]|You brought the whole--||[Logic]|Yeah, we brought the whole team||[Driving Instructor]|Oh, excuse me, who is taking the picture?||[Logic]|I'm upset that I did what I'm supposed to do. That's the thing I'm telling you man. It's not like a fail. I've failed before, many times. It's just that when you know you did everything, you know you did it||[Christian Martin]|We're at the DMV. Bob's taking his driving test for the second shot. And uh, I'm a little bit nervous. I know he can drive, but just these instructors take of points for the craziest things||[Logic]|Thank you, 29, I can go in through here. Swag||Got that license though||[Black Spiderman Piano interlude]||[Logic]|""Black Spiderman"" I wrote, first and foremost, it's about stereotypes, and that people make me believe I should be ashamed of who I am, and I'm not||[Logic in the booth]||[Logic]|Like, be you, fuck EVERYBODY else, just be you. And people are goig to hate on you, they hate on me and my message is ""Peace, Love and Positivity"", and people HATE me. Like think about that... That's CRAZY! When you look at people you see things. You see a black man, you see a middle eastern man, you see,... there are people that are conditioned to look at people of color or people that are brown on an airplane a little weird. and that's so FUCKED up and I hate  that. People look at me and I go, ""I'm a rapper"", and they go ""What?"" or people are conditioned to not accept me in hip-hop because of how  i look, or how i speak. ""Oh, you speak white"" or ""you talk white"", like the fuck? I've heard that my whole life I'm saying in general for this career. What do you mean ""talk white""? What the fuck does that mean?||I said fuck that, why can't Spiderman be black? Why can't James Bon be gay? Why not? like fuck it! And that's why I open it up with ""Black Jesus, Black Jesus"". And people are like ""What? Black Jesus? What the fuck?"" Like I've got a Black Santa Clause right now in my house||[Booth Session]||[Logic]|I've known Damien for 6-7 years now, maybe even 8 years. And we've just been buddies like through the internet. And we used to do records together. I wasn't shit, I wasn't nobody. I knew I wanted him to be on the album, and he dropped EVERYTHING to come out here. With no promise of placement or anything like that, just to see where he could contribute. And I'm sitting down there, and we're working, and I'm like ""I think I need some vocals on here"". And, like I said, i trust everybody, who knows what's going to happen? You want to go in there, and let's see what you got. He told me before Bobby hit record, that you could hear it in the microphone, his heart pumping||[Damian Lemar Hudson]|And like, I could just feel the magnitude of this moment. And how pivotal it was||[Logic]|He was like ""this is 6 years in the making that just came out"". And...||[Damian]|I don't know, something just hit me and I started letting loose||[Damian in the booth]||[Damian]|Something about that, some type of [?] grabbed me and let me soar vocally||[Logic while listening]|YES! Praise him! I'm putting this on the album! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW (to Damian). COME HERE!||[Logic]|You just earned yourself a feature credit||[Damian]|It was like one of those milestones in your career where you know you're just in the right room, and the right mind state. Everything just lined up||[Logic]|I only work with people that are as good and creative as I am in their field. I like when people make me feel fucking stupid. I like  when people are so good at playing strings, or piano, or singing, or whatever that makes me feel talentless. I can't do what they do. Like I'm Batman. I'm Player 1, I'm Super Mario, so are you guys behind the camera, so is 6ix. I don't work with Player 2s, I don't work with Robins. I work with other Batmen, and I know that sounds really weird, but what i mean by that is you, whenever you leave, and you take this camera to do whatever you do, you are a boss. You're a boss, and you go do boss shit. But when you're with me, you're under my wing, being a boss, helping me paint my boss-ass picture||[C-Sick]|With Logic, time to go to the basement. It's my time to shine. Hopefully I have something that actually like fit on the project||[Mos Definitely Interlude]||[C-Sick]|When i first met [?] I could see this [?]||[Logic in the booth]||[Killer Mike]|I mean, he's a superior lyricist. We already know that. He puts together classic albums, we know that. This is beautiful, it's rich, it's moody, it revs you up and brings you down. It's an ALBUM, and in an age where that may not be important, it's refreshing. You know? so, bravo! I've told him before, I think he's one of the best in the world||[Logic]|Mannnn, come on. Thanks man||[Lucy Rose]|Logic's music makes me feel something. I don't listen to a whole lot of hip-hop or rap music. And when I first met Bobby he did ask me "" Why do you listen to my music? Like I don't understand"". ""Like you play this sweet folk music and then you listen to my music."" but there's something about it I just can't explain, but it makes me really feel something||[Logic]|It's kind of scary. I can't explain. like when I first started making music I was willing to sacrifice everything because I had nothing to lose. But now, i have everything to lose. That isn't a bad thing. That just means I have a good life||It makes me work harder. Because I was working so hard to obtain all of this. But now I have to work even harder to keep it|Ooooo I just gave you some fire!||With my last album I went around to radio stations, and I shook hands, and I jerked people off. And I was like ""Yeah what's up!"" trying to get radio placements. But not like trying to work for the radio, but like trying to get more people to hear. And  this time, I'm like fuck that shit. I'm not going nowhere, i'm not doing any press. This album has already done what it was intended to do, and it was to set me free of any shame the public made me feel. It did what it was intended to do because I don't give a shit what anybody else thinks||And I'm really not gonna try to get too much into it, but I had a conversation with J. Cole about the public, and being on social media, and all these things. Like I don't need the public to accept me. I don't need anybody to tell me my music is great, or I'm amazing. Because I know I'm good, I know I'm great, and I know I'm amazing. Just like you, and them, so fuck anybody else and what they got to say because I know I'm good, and that's what this album is about.

Being raised in a household full of drugs, guns, violence, um, just all that, but not letting it effect who you are, because on the first verse, I'm rapping from the perspective of little Bobby, me, who I am, just- you know, that little kid in that house and all the things that he witnessed and on the second- uh, on the second verse, I'm rapping from the perspective of my brother, someone who was in the streets and running around, and you know, maybe doing things that he shouldn't have done at the time||So for me, it was like showing you what can come from the same household. You can go left, or you can go right. I think a lot of people go that traditional route, when you're raised around- um, these things that can touch you. In a negative way, I think. For me I just saw it as a very positive, and decided to do my best not to go down the same route as a lot of my family members, unfortunately. Uh, so this is basically just the story of possibility. Uh, of what can come, and what can happen and my rendition, if you will, of stop the violence, you know, it's also sort of an homage to KRS-One as well, that's why I threw his vocals in there. Um, but yeah, I just wanted people to know what happens where I come from in Maryland, as beautiful as a place it is, its also a dark place, and I think that's everywhere you go in the world.

Logic,Growing Pains III (Commentary Version),2014,"Growing Pains III (Commentary Version) LyricsThis one, wow, this one meant a lot to me, um... First and foremost because the original ""Growing Pains I & II"" were on mixtapes and before this album, I did, uh, the mixtape Welcome To Forever and there was no ""Growing Pains,"" uh, from any part of the series on that. So I think a lot of people thought that it may have been over and there wasn't going to be another one, and i wanted to give them that feeling of ""wow!"" like ""wow."" ""Growing Pains III"" and all these people who heard these things on the mixtape like ""Man, he's still there. He's still Logic,"" like ""Wow."" I'm a fan, I know what it's like, and you kind of dread like ""Ohh, what's that album gonna sound like?"" For me, I wanted to give them this||It opens up with a skit, and I love Wu-Tang Clan, so I always loved their skits, so it's basically about the first time I ever heard gunshots outside of my window as a little boy. And then it opens up, ""Outside I can hear 'em bussin', bussin', and the police they rushin', go to my head like concussion"" And I'm about fifteen years old at that time, and the gunshots, I still hear them every now and then throughout my life and I'm wondering, I always used to wonder ""What caused that shootout?"" Why did I hear his? What was it? So I kind of created the fictitious tale of something that was, in fact, a true event. So that goes in, when you first hear me rapping I'm laying in bed at fifteen years old and all the things racing through my mind, from the eviction notice on my door, you know, just being on food stamps and welfare and not knowing what's going to happen tomorrow and just, all the wonders. And then the beat changes up and I actually fall asleep. So this is my inner-most subconscious thoughts that I didn't even realize at the time, at fifteen years old, but now, you know, at twenty-four and looking back, reminiscing, I know that those are the things that are on my mind, because growing up in that situation, no matter what, um, the only time I was special, the only time I was anybody was when I was asleep. When I was asleep I was a famous basketball player, baseball player, I was a rapper/artist, I was a singer, I was an actor, I was dancer, I was an astronaut, but when I woke up I was just a boy from a broken home, and that- that was very hard to swallow||Even touching upon the lines about the television and feeling like that family, you know growing up on The Cosby's  and Family Matters, and you know, that was the closest thing I had to a real family. Once the television program turned off, or our electricity turned off, I snapped back to reality.

Uh, Kebu from Atlanta originally did the first rendition of this song, um, with the sample that we later replayed, um, that's when I brought in DJ Khalil... and it was kind of just the fun, braggadocios-ness of hip-hop, yet really beginning to tell my story as well - Just in the flow, the cadence, kinda just showing off skill, um, but still telling that story and painting the picture of where the album conceptually was headed||Then, on the second half, uh, that's where, you know you really get into, uh, just the mental state of a hungry emcee, you know, releasing his first album. So for me, um, this song is just damn near six minutes of hip hop, you know, the emcee - Who I am, and how I want to be perceived.... As an artistYou might also likeEmbed"

Logic,Metropolis (Commentary Version),2014,"Metropolis (Commentary Version) Lyrics""Metropolis."" This is... um, one of my favorites on the album. It's produced by Rob Knox and myself, and um, I had such a blast with him creating the song. Uh, you know, the classic break and just kind of doing my rendition of that break and putting that together and then, uhh, Rob just playing the keys and it rose over... it's just such an incredible vibe. You know? And-and, it's basically a tale of, um, my time around the world touring. Starting out in College Park, Maryland with all the homies back in the basement, um, uh hitting the road, you know what I'm saying? In a minivan, for the first time ever, in the freezing cold and going to Chicago and selling out my first show there... and different things like that until eventually going to Europe and riding the train and, uh, ended up in Belgium and Amsterdam and Switzerland and this and that and all these really beautiful places and I just wanted to talk about it. Talk about my fear of flying, which I'm getting over, all these, just, I wanted the people to hear the humility and the honesty and just like, you know...||It's weird, even now, recording this for Spotify and the listeners now, like, I-I love Spotify, I've been using Spo- this is where I find all my samples and to think that there's somebody out there, listening to me talk to them, and they want to know about my album; it's very surreal.

Logic,I’m Gone (Commentary Version),2014,"I’m Gone (Commentary Version) LyricsThis song to me, this was like the actual first song... I guess, that you could say with structure, you know like um, just verse, hook, bridge. It was much more than just a beautiful intro, and much more than just six minutes of raps, like the previous record, this was a full length song. This is, you know, ""okay, we get it, the kid can rap, the kid can, you know, have fun, but let me hear him create something"" and that's what I wanted to do on ""I'm Gone."" Funny enough, you know, 6ix produced damn near the majority of the entire album himself, and we were in the studio and we had just finished, um, I think it was, uh, the intro, I think that was one of the last ones that we did actually, and on the ride home he was like ""Man, I just want to get one more, I just wanna get one more"" and I was like ""Hey, if you can do it..."" And then the next day, you know, he made this beat and um, and I wrote to it and for me this is my inspiration. Me talking about my old inspiration. Of maybe just money and women and cars, the cliche hip-hop thing that I think a lot of people kind of get into hip hop for, just fun stuff, but- um, kind of getting rid of that and going ""I'm going to tell my story,"" finding the inspiration of wanting to just be myself, and let the world know who I am and just make.... music. So it sounds as though I'm talking about a woman, uh, getting rid of my own ""woman,"" and getting with my new ""woman"" - my new inspiration and leading into this albumYou might also likeEmbed"

Logic,Nikki (Commentary Version),,"Nikki (Commentary Version) Lyrics'Kay, ""Nikki."" Spoiler alert here, if you- if you don’t understand the concept of ""Nikki,"" or you haven't heard the song yet, please do listen to that before you continue with this, please. For me, I was always- I'm- I’m just a huge fan of music. You know, I wear my heart on my sleeve, my inspirations on my sleeve, and one of them is Kanye West. And I always loved his song ""Addiction."" You know, ""What's you addiction? Is it money? Is it cars? Is it [gibberish]? I got addict-"" You know, it's just like, I wanted to do something as well||But like I said, I grew up in a- in a pretty crazy household and I saw, you know, the use of narcotics and alcohol, and how it destroyed my family, so I-I never really went down that, so I-I never really had an addiction except cigarettes... And I thought, ""Well, that's kinda corny."" Like, you know what I mean? Cigarettes is so frowned upon. How can I do it in a way where people can relate to it? And then I-I-I discovered the concept of Nikki, and taking it much more further than just this song: putting her all over the album. And if I talk about Nikki as if she is in fact a woman, then it would- it would- it would allude to that||And um, but it's even before then. You know, I mean nine months before the album was even out, I would hashtag ""Who's Nikki?"" on Twitter, this or that. Who's Nikki? Who's Nikki? And everybody was wondering, everybody thinks, ""Is it his mom? Is it an ex-girlfriend? Is it it a this? Is it his sister? Is it-blah"" And everybody wants to know, everybody wants to know. Then you hear me on the record, on ""Bounce,"" ""In the whip, everyday wit’ Nikki, she be ridin’ wit' me."" You know? Different things like that, and you’re like, ""What? Who is this chick? Who is this chick?""||And then you get to the song, and I-I-I wrote it, as almost as if it was a break-up song. ""I love it when you're fresh. I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath."" Like, uhh, matters of making love, or this or that. And when you finally get to the end and it's like ""nicotine,"" it's like that ""wow"" moment, you know? I remember watching SAW for the first time and realizing that the killer was in the room the entire time, and I was like, ""Oh my god!"" You know what I mean? So, that’s what I wanted to create, and I think I did my best to create a song where it's not just nicotine. I could be heroin, it could be alcohol, it could be sex, it could be gambling, it could be whatever your thing is, um... Maybe it isn't even that bad, or maybe it's just a man or a woman that you're dealing with. Or...

Logic,Buried Alive (Commentary Version),,"Buried Alive (Commentary Version) Lyrics""Buried Alive."" Um, ""Buried Alive"" to me is, once again, the story of the duality of man. You know, um, the conflict and internal struggle that we face. You know, that first thing you hear, ""Tell me how you feel,"" uh, I take that as the instrumentation, almost as a therapist. Telli- saying, ""Tell me. How- how do you feel?"" You know, the one thing I can talk to for hours and hours, days on days. Um, and know that it'll never stop listening to me, um, and if anything, it- it constantly wants more. Uh, you can- you can definitely hear my- uh, OutKast inspiration- uh, in this song, as well as the- the rest of the album, but it all really started on here. Um, you know, my fun- the ""You, you’s,"" and the ""Yeah, yeah, aw yeah."" All that stuff kinda in the hooks that give it that Logic sound, um...||Uh, but yeah, the AT-aliens, I call it the ""three stack"" where it kinda sounds like an alien, you know what I mean? Like uh, the angel on one shoulder, and the devil on the other and just... going back and forth and, that- that little voice in your mind telling you that you can't. When you believe and you have all the courage, uh, and truly feel like you can do it, you can make it and whatever you want. Whether it's school, you know, your profession, your career, your hobby, your this, your that, you can do it. But there’s always that voice sayin', ""No, no you can't."" And that's who I'm fighting with||Um, at the time, you know, I was very- I was like, ""Aw man, you know, how come- how come this rapper has a cosign from him?"" or ""How come this-that?"" or ""They get this"" or ""They get that."" Like, ""But I can tour the world!"" You know, I think it came from, not the typical mad rapper, but just a place of anger. Like, ""I have fans all over the world, I can tour all over the world, I don't understand."" And realizing like, ""Hey, the grass isn't always greener. I'm sure there’s a lot of those rappers with the big cosigns or the names here, this or that, but they can’t do the numbers."" They can- their like, ""Why can't I tour like, you know, like a Logic."" Or ""Why can’t I?"" this, ""How come my fanbase isn't-"" You know, so the grass truly isn't always green on the other side, however I feel as though, you know, the more famous, and more Logic is known, less and less and less people know Bobby.
