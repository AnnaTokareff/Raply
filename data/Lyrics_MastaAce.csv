Thank you for your time...and have a nice day||[Verse 1]|How do you do?|I'm from the other side of town|The place where the only skin you see is the color brown|The sun never shines in this place where I live|And it's hard to do right when you feel negative|I have no compassion|I only know aggression|And there is nothing great about this oppression|People I see on TV, in there towns live the good life|But I live out of bounds|Where nobody comes unless they're forced to come|In school, they call me the bum from the slum|But they don't know|My sista has no food to eat|And her hand-me-down shoes are too tight for her feet|The way I see things, life isn't fair|So I never learned how to share or to care|But to hope - and hope|Instead of feeling down|And that's how it is|On the other side of town|I live on the other side of town||[Verse 2]|Pardon me, brotha|As you stand in your glory|I hope you don't mind as I tell the whole story|Some people livin' life like fun in the sun|But yo, others are givin' strife, and that's all they know|I feel no comfort in talks from the President|So put back on Cosby|A shack is my residence|I think if I ever die, it might be a blessin'|Some say I never try, but why are they stressin'|I'll never get ahead; my raps have a better chance|I'm livin' on Wonder Bread with holes in my leather pants|I'm not on the drug scene; they call me a crack head|I just had a bugged dream that I was a black man|Workin' in the hospital|Then in came in a half-dead rich bitch|Yo, they must be insane|You think I would save her?|Yo, she wouldn't save me|I asked for a quarter once, and guess what she gave me|A fuckin' penny|Her coat costs half a mill|If it's up to me, yo, she's pushin' up daffodils|In a casket|Payback's a female dog|Yo, send her ass to the morgue|Then I woke up, and I sat with a frown|Damn, I woke up|But on the other side of town|You might also likeThe other side of town||[Verse 3]|My teacher's a fat man|Yo, how can they tempt me so|Fuck geometry, my stomach is empty, yo|Can't you teach me to win this crazy game?|You and I are in so many ways the same|People tell me, but I don't believe that shit|Why do you sell me a dream, then leave me spit?|The truth is bare, and so is my cupboards, too|I wonder what could even L. Ron Hubbard do|Because my mind right now is on the brink of breakin'|Yo, look how I think|I think I'll stick up the store with the Arab guy|I'm sick of him anyway; his prices are too high|Or maybe I'll start sellin' Avon door-to-door|Then pull a jammy, and make a bigger score|Nah, maybe I'll start sellin' dope for my cuz|Then I could drive the same car he does|The life of a poor man|Consider me desperate|I sleep in a cold room|And wish I could just get|A piece of the pie|Is that asking too much?|I can't even reach what others have in their clutch|I wish I could go on, but I have to end this|And get back to livin' a life that is winless|There's no use swimmin', so I might as well drown|In my sorrows|'Cause tomorrow's the other side of town|[Outro]|The other side of town|The other side of townEmbed"

Masta Ace,Rap 2K1,,"Rap 2K1 Lyrics[Verse 1: Masta Ace]|Last month I spent two weeks on a vacation|I had a dream that I was inside of my PlayStation|Did you ever lay down, take a nap and lose it?|I dreamt I was stuck in this game called Rap Music|I started off underground in a dark room|With a freestyle, a sawed-off pump and a harpoon|That transform to a pen in case of a words war|And opened the first door that led to the first floor|I got attacked by a couple of rap acts|They wore dreads, these army pants and these backpacks|I hit one over the head with a broken verb|The motherfucker tried to hit me with some spoken word|But it didn't work, and I finished him and his boys|And disappeared from the scene without making a noise|I used up four bars but I earned a punchline|And proceeded to Level 2: Land of the Unsigned|[Hook:]|We don't play those games|Would you listen here?|What I'm doing here?|Get me outta here|We don't play those games|This is getting wild|Can you tell me how?|Let me out now|We don't play those games|How'd I get in here?|Let me outta here|What I'm doing here?|We don't play those games|This is no fun|Got me on the run|Rap 2K1||[Verse 2: Masta Ace ]|I got attacked right away when I walked in|By a four-foot manager with a contract and a pen|I put up my force shield to block any attempt|At this shrimp draining my life twenty percent|The floor opened up and I almost fell inside|But I used my mic right, I swung to the other side|And just when I thought I avoided the booby trap|I got slapped by a female MC with a doobie rag|And this chick was trying to be herd like she raised cattle|But I remembered something I seen on the Blaze Battle|Whoever sold you them shoes, they fooled you|I killed her with a verse about her fucked up weave and her fake FUBU|A record exec then appeared in a black limo|And started to attack with a bag full of wack demos|And I will admit: it was hard as hell to kill|So I stabbed him with an invoice and a studio bill|You might also like[Hook:]|We don't play those games|Would you listen here?|What I'm doing here?|Get me outta here|We don't play those games|This is getting wild|Can you tell me how?|Let me out now|We don't play those games|How'd I get in here?|Let me outta here|What I'm doing here?|We don't play those games|This is no fun|Got me on the run|Rap 2K1||[Verse 3: Masta Ace]|I made it to the next level: Above Ground|My sound scanner then picks up on this bug sound|I pull out the sawed-off pump and I get it cocked|And that's when this A&R crawled from under a rock|And start shooting opinions, I stop, drop and I roll|'Cause if they was to hit me, they'd penetrate to my soul|I hid behind some trees and I held my weapon tightly|His street team was up on the roof trying to snipe me|It took a while to finish em all but I finally did it|Then out comes this powerful beast known as the critic|With a fully loaded magazine and mad drama|My harpoon shots just bounced off of his armor|Now I wish I would've stayed down in the dark caves|I'm running towards these big-ass fans with these sharp blades|But he was right behind me holding a flame thrower|So I jumped through the blades and I died, game over|[Hook:]|We don't play those games|Would you listen here?|What I'm doing here?|Get me outta here|We don't play those games|This is getting wild|Can you tell me how?|Let me out now|We don't play those games|How'd I get in here?|Let me outta here|What I'm doing here?|We don't play those games|This is no fun|Got me on the run|Rap 2K1Embed"
