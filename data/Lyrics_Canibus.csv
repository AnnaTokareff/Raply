Canibus,Greatest Freestyle,2001,"Greatest Freestyle Lyrics[Verse 1]|I think fast, switch fast, quick fast, quick as|Immigrants say, ""No habla ingles"", at border-patrol fences|Messin' with Canibus is senseless|Divide my senses by six and you'll end up with triple sixes|And triple the digits mean triple the spirits|My light body to the third power will triple my lyrics|I'm triple the threat, I'm triple my physical flesh|I'm telling you, put your money on me, then triple your bet|‘Cause I won't be satisfied 'til I'm set|'Til I got a triplex out in Tribeca with the skyline effect|Rhyming is the nine-to-five that I manipulate best|Eight hours of writing and memorizing a manuscript|Called ""The Biography of Canibus,"" subtitled ""The Ultimate Guide for Teaching Modern Man How to Spit""|How to tongue-twist, how to enunciate certain shit|How to control your breath, how to make your syllables spit|Y'all niggas ain't listen to Bis, I kill ‘em with shit|I'm wicked with this, I should be selling tickets to this|Paparazzi should probably be taking pictures of this|My fans in the street with signs tryin' to picket for this|Saying, ""We want ‘Bis! We want ‘Bis!|We want the rapper with the illest lyrics!""|My dedication and my commitment's beginning-less|I can go four quarters or nine innings for this|Go twelve rounds, play two days of cricket for this|Lead crusades across Europe, like the Christians for this|The notion I'm dedicated is an understatement|My rhymes are out of this world like the Russian space-station|Sneak-attack rappers, grab 'em and slash 'em|Chop their heads off with claws sharper than velociraptors|Hunt 'em, like Jurassic Park actors|But spare Samuel Jackson's life|‘Cause he was the only black one|Action-packed like Shaft, the black assassin|Blastin' the .753 backwards Magnum|Follow me down the road to Damascus|Do not follow these madmen, poppin' ecstasy pills like aspirin|I and I come fe manifest the most high|Drink a gallon of cyanide and still cannot die|Niggas want to lock the ‘Chronicles of Canibus' away forever|And put my book of rhymes through a shredder|Never, I'm way too clever the way I manoeuvre|Beat your ass, like Lennox Lewis did to David Tua|In front of a hundred-million pay-per-viewers|Your career is ruined|Your face will be swollen, like the Benihana Buddha|Bring it to ya, prove you're a loser|Beyond the length of this rhyme you have no future|Pounce upon you, like a puma or some wild cougars|In the jungle with my adrenaline juices flowing through 'em|I'ma reprogram everything that you're doin'|Hypnotize the audience you perform in front of to start booin'|You're stupid, you and your whole crew are extremely foolish|I can't cipher with you, ‘cause your breath is too putrid|Put your mic down and step away from it!|Shut your motherfucking mouth and don't say nothin'!|You have the right to remain silent|Sentenced to life on Rikers Island for terrible freestylin'|[Verse 2]|I heard a rumor English women make love the best|Is that true? ‘Cause I ain't had no justice yet|A lot of clowns keep arguing on who the best is|Bite the style but can't digest it|'Til they get karate-kicked in the mouth|And their teeth get ejected|Told you to watch who you beef with on the last record|Platinum teeth? I sell them for a thousand pounds a piece|You buy one back and you get one free|Put it down in the East, put it down in the West|Put it down on paper, put the paper down on the desk|In the studio is where I put it down to the test|It's nothing but skull-crushing pressure down at them depths|Throw a rough mix down, download it to disk|Give a copy to everybody that's down with Bis|Since '96, the Dogg Pound Remix|First time anybody put me down to spit|It's like Pac Man, don't stop, 'til I hear my voice|Banging up and down the block in a Magnavox|With a hundred watts|Creating ripples in the water, like aquanauts|Breathing through their oxygen-box|I belong on top of the pops, not on the bottom with rocks|I mean, honest to God, I'm shocked|I thought the album was hot|I guess you can't write an infinite rhyme with a finite mind|That's why rhymes like mine mystify mankind|A lot of rappers are ahead of their time|But when it comes to rhymes like mine|The word ""time"" doesn't apply|You see, rhyming is the art|The microphone is the paintbrush|Responsible for getting the point across|The canvas is the street, where the Master of the Ceremony paints the picture for everybody to see|Nobody could rhyme this fluent|Nobody ever did what I'm doin'|Nobody ever spit what I'm spewin'|I'm the illest alive and I'ma prove it, plus I've got to show the people that I've got mad love for Rap music|I bury MC's with rosary beads|A picture of their wife and their seeds and a picture of me|I'm as graceful as the left hand of Rembrandt|Put some instrumentals on|And ask my pen to dance; I'm such a gentleman|Pull out chairs, open doors, never offend my fans|Unless they offend me and I lose my temper, manYou might also like11Embed"

cars and beautiful Asian broads|He had a strong mind, he used to philosophize|About rhymes while he was pruning his bonsai|He claimed that he had written the greatest rhyme of all time|But he would never take it out his archives|He wrote two songs per day|And was constantly experimenting with his wordplay|In his youth he did a report on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey|He got an F but he deserved an A|I followed his career from the first day|It seemed a lack of support contributed to his inert ways|I seen him pull in twenty-four hour workdays|With deferred pay, undeterred by the word ""shame""|Public humiliation was the worst pain|He was spinning out of control like a Class 5 hurricane|He said he wouldn't want another MC to suffer the same|Especially when there's nothing to gain|He was the illest alive but nobody would face it|He spit till his tongue was too torched to taste it|Privately funded corporations carbon dated his latest creations|To extract the information|They found it utterly amazing|They claimed the body of his work was the same thing as a priceless painting|Never mattered to him that art galleries hated him|'Cause Thomas Kinkade called and said he would take ten|Complete enigmas wrapped in puzzles encrypted in language|With sound but without shape or signature|Kept files in his garage on MS-DOS|In a fire-proof pod, we thought it was odd|Outside there was a shed with an Oppenheimer lock|He apparently kept more wax than Madame Tussaud's|We were in total awe 'cause it blew our minds|So many rhymes that were intricately designed|He was Poet Laureate of his time|And if you don't mind, I'd like to share some of his rhymes|Alone in my room looking through the 32X telescope zoom|Adjusting the focus of the moon|One should not assume the philosophy of David Hume|Is nothing more then a subjective conclusion|What is the maximum field rate application?|The runaway glaciation surrounding the ocean basin|Affects the population fluctuation|On a continuous basis but that's just the basics|The juxtaposition of Canibus' position|The precision of something no other has written|Way above and beyond what was intended|The unparalleled malleable enunciation of a sentence|You didn't go to college obviously|I can tell by your ungodly unintelligible terminology|A remarkable odyssey, the rhymes of modern speeds|When the brain orders the body not to breathe|Your competency is not up to speed, you're not in my league|You couldn't possibly be hotter then me|Or oppositely your minus twenty-five degrees|You'd squeeze but the condensation makes rifle barrels freeze|Allow me to speak figuratively, nigga please|My intellectual properties are about the size of Greece|Your counselor advised you not to speak|My counselor advised me to keep rhyming until they stopped the beat|In the words of Joseph Heller, ""I learned how to write better|Even though it sort of irked me""|He said he didn't understand the process of the imagination|But he felt he was at its mercy|Which explains my point perfectly and certainly reinforces|The reason why nobody's probably ever heard of me|Couldn't understand what I mean by ill|Unless you try to translate what I print to film|This is the line, the reel, the circle of time|The cycle of eternity, the emergence of one line|Academic phonetics render critics tongue-tied|And personifies dry humor of cum laude alumni|A wise man sees failure as progress|A fool divorces his knowledge and misses the logic|And loses his soul in the process|Obsessed with nonsense with a caricature that has no content|My style is masterful, multilateral|I could battle a fool and be naturally cruel|Words of scorn are a disastrous tool|From an existentialist's view I'm a better rapper than you|Grab the mic and rip your physical fabric in two|My attitude is fucked up but admirable|Different methods interpreted into different forms|From entirely different perceptions and seen from different norms|Not just spitting a poem, there’s much more involved|There's much more pieces of the puzzle for you to solve|Forty-eight orders of mechanical laws|And rays of creational cause enhance the cadence of my bars|Maybe I am self-absorbed|But that's the effect, to find the cause you should ask my A&R|Today is what it is, but only because yesterday was what it was|Permitting you heard of Beelzebub|A tale of demons and drugs, pissy drunk in the club|With the DJ doing the needle rub|Chances are you'll never see me son|Yeah I know my name's Canibus but I can't help you if you need a dub|I came to holla at some big booty bitches and listen to the speakers thump|Where you get conceited from?|I'm so nice on the mic they wanna beat me up|It's deep as fuck, I ain't seen it all but I've seen enough|Really unbelievable stuff|There's a lot of times when I want to speak but I'm stuck|I should leave this rap shit alone|And kick my incredible rhymes in the privacy of my own home|My imagination is my own|The liberty to speak to freely lyrically on the microphone|With a pen in my hand, I bring motion to the Enneagram|And become ""Can-I Millenium Man""|Engrave my back with the emperor's stamp|Been spitting scientific rap since the 17th century began|Trying to escape the wicked empire of Def Jam|And the land where lyrics are bland and heretics hang|Every warrior has an axe to bury|But he has to learn to discern between enemy and adversary|I said to myself, ""Germaine, this is insane|It's suicide, it's controlled flight into terrain""|I fought to regain control of the plane, but went up in a ball of flames|And got banned from the Hip-Hop hall of fame|For two bars I kept hearing in my head|Over and over again, it cost me everything|I'm convinced now that more than the truth is at stake|Where people create language that pretends to communicate|Euphemisms are misunderstood as mistakes|But its a byproduct of the ghetto music we make|From an extroverted point of view I think its too late|Hip Hop has never been the same since '88|Since it became a lucrative profession|There's a misconception that a movement in any direction is progression|Even though the potency of it lessens|Big money industries writing checks to suppress the question|And nobody gives a fuck no more, no one goes to the book store|Ever since the confluence of Moore's Law|But I stay in the lab like Niels Bohr and his son Aage|Edward Lorenz and Leo Szilard|Lyrically I took rap music and turned the knob|To the right full throttle and added panache|Why would I argue with my own conscience over the truth?|That's like me telling myself, ""Don't tell me what to do""|Dialyses and analyses of battle MCs|Sometimes I say things I myself can't believe|My lyrical is so skillfully elliptical|I can understand how it makes you miserable|You wonder why I never let you play your beats for me|Or why I keep my studio enshrouded in secrecy|You wonder what's my infatuation with Alicia Keys|""Canibus why don't you speak to me?""|Yo, I meant it when I said no one can shine on a song that features me|That's why I said it so vehemently|You need to replace the hate with respect|I'm probably the best yet, Poet Laureate|[Outro — James Dickey sample]|Generally I take… I go with the given, you know, with what comes ta me over, the celestial wireless… Whenever it comes. You’re lucky when you get itYou might also like7Embed"

Canibus,Curriculum 101,2002,"Curriculum 101 Lyrics[Intro: movie sample]|Claims are being made that for me go far beyond the available evidence and in fact in many cases are contradicted by the evidence and that bothers me||[Verse: Canibus]|Forensic psychologist Samuel Dubios explains|""You'll probably never understand Germaine""|Incoherent speeches, puzzles in pieces|The sub-chemical deepness of his glandular excretions|Realms of Heaven and Hell|Glowing angelic gel spliced with bovine leukaemia cells|Demons in Hell they call to me, I scream, ""What can you offer me?""|They reply, ""Techno-Sorcery""|They tell me the meek will never inherit the world|'Cause they're weak standing on two 12 inch feet|I dream quasi-Draconian dreams when I sleep|Peyote leaves mixed with the blood of a priest|In a room where the ceiling leaks of crimson grease|Where the living eats the dead and the dead reek|Rock bottom transforms human beings to beasts|Why the fuck you think we got canine teeth?|It's the optical stimuli of watching men cry|I hope I've got time to repent before I die|Bury me at the beach if the sea is out of reach|'Cause when I speak what's fluid becomes concrete|Like a falcon up in the sky, ten thousand feet|Looking down at you bitches looking at me|Phase shifting to 45°|I'm too crooked to see, I memorize the books that I read|Sucking from the breast of knowledge – constantly weaning|Unbeseemingly a genius without meaning|Try to visualize what Harry Houdini was feeling|Handcuffed underwater without breathing|Near death on a fatal quest for air|But why should anyone care? He put himself there|His career was based on facing his fears|To take destiny from the hand of the man upstairs|He didn't mind the cold stares he got from his peers|They couldn't tell him where he was going or how to get there|It's better to be prepared and fail|Than to be scared and unsure of yourself and still get killed|Don't rhyme like I used to but I still got skills|More than a couple confirmed kills under the belt|Hunting MCs like hunting elk|Camouflaged in the dense brush for stealth, determined as Hell|I don't do this for anybody except myself|Stuff a motherfucker like a trophy on my shelf|Fuck the promo nigga I do this for dolo|Flow from the first hour to 24:00|Round the clock as long as I've got a cup of cocoa|But I'll be a no-show if my girl cries, ""Don't go!""|And she gives me blow more than two times in a row|I'd rather chill with her than kill you with a rhyme that I wrote|Count how many mics I smoke minus the G.O.A.T|'Bus is dope, my battling average higher than most|When I'm on the mic I release fire from throat|If you disagree please do it quietly folks|Anybody better than Bis must be a hoax|Black man? No! What about the Great White Hope?|What? Man you must be sniffing great white coke|Don't you know that's like Gary Coleman fighting the Hulk?|Still not even quite that close, a great white|Biting your rubber dingy boat 50 miles out from the coast|What the fuck is the Mathers with you?|I'll beat you black and blue then I'll get a tat of you too|Better yet I'll put a tattoo of me on you|A ten by ten 'C' logo – neon blue|The most theatrical MC battle of all time|I rip jackers like you, you know my call sign|Killer cobras that hover over Jehovah|In motorized auto-giros with sycamore rotors|Hydrogen-peroxide, gaseous vapors|Technically these words shouldn't even rhyme off paper|In theory, for every soul that can hear me, I'ma blaze them|In practical practice my style's even greater|Can't you see what I'm spitting? Can't you hear the difference?|Compared to me you're energetically inefficient|You need ten times the enzymes to process one of my rhymes|You've got to rewind every one of my lines|Do you know how to paraphrase?|Do you even understand what the narrator is tryna say?|The climax explodes, nobody can foreshadow my flow|Figuratively the language is too dope|Academic journals print my lyrical quotes|They show parallelism in all the albums I wrote|On any track I come off strong automatically|Whether I write in an active or passive capacity|Poetry that I spit is synonymous to a glyph|Written on tablets of clay mortar mix|Superb, truly superb! Analyze the words|It's like observing the birds fly above the Earth|The Eye of Horus, the miniature torii within a giant torus|With singularity on the chorus, I still sound enormous|Borderline insanity trying to break through humanity's border|With a new curriculum every quarter|I'm the porter of the portal of the Secret Mic Club Order|Baptize you with Jamaican white rum and water|If you've got a hundred bars then I know you're a warrior|I'll be the one who awards you and pins the medal on you|Dedicate a song to you because now you're honorable|You want a record deal?|Explain the lyrical Grand Unified Field so I can test your skill|Do it in front of the class, chart diagram it|And write it in Latin not Spanish god damn it|Step back so I can look at it|(No puede entender las palabras que digo senior Williams?)|Huh?

the scene|My blades will cut up your back like a rowing machine|It could get ugly if they don't intervene|Cuz I could make your life flash before your eyes like I'm throwing it beads|I'm incoherent or so it would seem|No I'm esoteric and don't care if you know what I mean, that's the spirit|Cuz its apparent if you took half of what passes for lyrics and compared them to mine|Hip hop should be fuckin' embarrassed|So did you really want to flow with the gods?|I'm too educated, haters couldn't cope with the odds|See I studied Biggie and Pac, Hova and Nas|Paganini and Bach, Beethoven and Brahms|You are now in the presence of a master musician|I craft my rap with the precision of a mathematician|Or a surgeon, performin' a thoracic incision|A magician escaping out of his shackles in prison|Before you could even finish saying ""Oh my God!""|I'll spit a motherfuckin' verse to fill your whole Ipod|I'm a Rip the Jacker protégé|Motivated by the golden age of rap back in the older days|The incredible little fellow with rhythm and timing on instrumentals|The shit I've said in the rhyme considered a federal crime|Like blowin off your head with a 9|Anyone with a shred of intelligence could tell its just ahead of its time|I'm too sick, ain't even talking about the music|Keep my fuckin' name out of your mouth, need a toothpick?|You a little confused like who's this dude|""This is a W-A-R-B-U-X-clusive""|The underdog, like back in the Bible with Noah's Ark|To entrusted military titles to Joan of Arc|To Napoleon Bonaparte down to Rosa Parks|And the medics attempting rescue, breathin' on Owen Hart|This fucker 'Bux is the shit|So who really gives a fuck if he's busting a clip|In public drunk in the trunk of your whip|The diabolical, alcoholical, comical pharmaceutically phenomenal|Product of poppin' pills|And you are not this ill, check your doctors bill|I'm more dangerous in the streets than a toxic spill|Yo this is 50 bars of sickness|Consider it a Christmas gift to you, Bis, don’t forget this!2Embed"

Canibus,Cingularity Point (Original),,"Cingularity Point (Original) Lyrics[Hook: Canibus]|The C of Tranquility, what will it really be?|What does the future hold? What do you really see?|I see a revolution in the industry|That will ignite the rebirth of MCs lyrically|The C of Tranquility, what will it really be?|What does the future hold? What do you really see?|I see the partition of God's religion|Become united by our bars and our common visions|The C of Tranquility, what will it really be?|What does the future hold? Yo, fuck the hook!|[Canibus]|These rhymes resemble knots being tied|The timeline becomes a nonlinear noose that will snap your mind|First: Sever your spine, Second: Normal limb configurations|Are dismembered and disconnected, very unpleasant|My third effort employs absurd ethics|Kangaroo execution court is in session after dawn but before breakfast|Expert effective mass burial method so well measured|It's impressive and intensive, not to mention expensive|Extensive templates taken from all global nano-industrial sectors|No wonder I'm so aggressive at Tetris|Pardon me, but I must beckon your attention|For no more than several seconds with the minor hypocritical questions|Let's say, I had to make an exception|Where I complied to exhume a body for postmortem autopsy inspection|I request the best yes-men|That promptly recovered the radio frequency identification pin|Then trigger the transponder located under the skin|Of the deceased until it showed me a grin|If that went over your head then I'll be more than pleased to show you again|But I must rescind, I have pressing matters to attend|It's my wife's birthday and I can't be late for delivery|Of her customized marble grey bidet, good day|What the fuck did he just say? See, why can't I bust my way?|Since '98 you could trust my name|I've adapted and adjusted my aim accordingly|The leap years are boring to me, I speed up quarterly|The Golden Era of Rap will always be apart of me|The future talks to me because the present is ignoring me|My destiny is calling me, the armory of God is guarding me|But all you can see is holographic artistry|This is were the road forks, my rhymes leave you lost|Under a blue moon, ice crystals, fog, and snow fall|Been a long time, spitting long rhymes, but I never left you|I always came back busting rhymes that were special|Back then, I wanted to impress you by addressing the truth|Nowadays, I'm just confessing in the booth|The music is layered, not computer generated|A human made it to satisfy unusual craving|The mystic in a room with crystal walls and floors|Looking into a crystal quartz orb, reciting lyrical law|That cause warm feeling sensations precipitating from the finger tips|To the arms, to the lips, to the jaws|To a gold tongue that spits to the tone of the drum|With the oxygen that flows down the throat to the lungs|'Til every color of my Chakra glows brighter than the Sun|You and I become We, We become One|And the clarity of Singularity has begun|Between zero point zero and zero point one|Combinatorics, anything of this persuasion|Is considered ageless beyond the matrix|Beyond time displacement of space and spaceships in oasis|Beyond the reach of human contemplation|Through my music, magic and convoluted interaction|Rip The Jacker shows you the future in fragments|Through madness my view is expanded|Request passage permission is granted|I'll introduce you to the language of dragons|To help balance near impossible trances in the labyrinth|Of the enchanted where air quality is unbearably rancid|From evil spirits, temperatures frigid|I cross wooden bridges over methane rivers, it sounds crazy, but listen|Concise lyrics strike down from the heavens|A titan like Mike Tyson, 'Beastmaster' with a Tiger and Pigeon|A four finger ring with a eyeball in it for vision|Cause I ain't scared of no 9 foot 11 winged lizards!|I'm known as the Ripper, my soul was delivered to a wizard|For spiritual slave labor in a prison|My life is my sentence, so I live it|But I studied the physics and understand it, so it's only a visit|I look at myself in the mirror, I see a stereoisomer image|I know it's cryptic, but you like what I'm spitting|M-M-M-M-Master in the art of rhyming, yield so many surprises|I've found excessive ferric-iron in my perinatal sinus|Remote viewing the globe, what I am shown runs my blood cold|My occipital lobe might explode!|The Godzilla Zillah God, enscripter encryptor|I drink the Elixir of Knowledge like it was a liquor!|I ain't a rapper, I'm a Ripper Slasher, Supreme Dream Catcher|Brother Frater who'd rather attend to other matters|Like mastering words, spell cast a curse you haven't heard|Incense I burn smells like a bag of herb!|I walk among the living hidden, but spitting, they bid me good riddance|Cause nobody knows what I've written!|Zecharia Sitchin in Hell's Kitchen, heavy lifting|Mixing, vocals switching with no mittens, my women keep bitching|Bitches drug experimenting, bed wetting and blood letting|White witches, black magic, rough wedding, with a fuck ending!|I ain't into fashion, think I got jokes?|Keep laughing, we'll have the ceremony in a cabin|Rapping my only compassion that outlasted everything I ever had in life|And it still respects the Master|During the brides reception, the Tree of Life supplied me the weapons|Inside the zodiac, divided in sections|I categorized five elements inscribing the lettering|Baphomet's unintelligible intelligence is benevolent!!|The initiate magician, not ready but willing|To perform molecular fission with emotions and feelings|I stand before the Rabbi with cat-eyes, he looked high|I don't mind, the motherfucker look crazy all the time|He asked me for the wedding band, I gave him the bride's severed hand|Punishment for touching another man|I'm just a poor shoe cobbler from Guadalajara|Who came in contact with scholars that studied Kabbalah|I do not wish to be a martyr and follow the footsteps of my father|I want to live the live of an 'honest farmer'|We all became sombre as I placed the animal on the altar|Started the fire, rinsed my hands in some water|Look into my eyes, I hypnotize my bride as I walk towards her|The congregation wouldn't take their eyes off her!|I hear moans and weeping coupled with soft but laboured breathing|I pinch myself, am I dreaming?|Invisible people speaking, we've met, but I don't remember meeting|I don't remember these traditional teachings|I know I'm reaching into unallowed boundaries, but the rhymes are increasing|My mind is breaching, I find it pleasing!|Inside the Theatre of Bar War, unlimited seating|The kills, still fresh, the cadavers, still bleeding|The war drum pounds like the wings of a owl beating|Right before it snares its prey and it begins feasting|How nice of you to join me this evening|To see the symphony for its surface complexity out of deep simplicity|You see, I achieve tranquility with obscure metaphors|Entering doors not placed between walls, but in the floor|Midnight strolls through groves of roses, sharing moments|With whatever hostess is closest, before the solstice approaches|The fire burns, but it burns smokeless|Ogres on flying locusts screaming, “Buenos noches!!”|The final battle with Vrill, the war cries build|Run them over on the battlefield with chariot wheels|My shield is composed of meteorite stone|My sword is honed from a red dragon's rib bones|Ripping and spitting basic complex combinatrix|For the agents trying to hack into my Matrix!|Five out of ten cases are found with their heads hacked off|In several places, hanging from metal braces|Long ago, the ghost of Plato befriended me|With a amulet intended to anchor my memories|Tabula Smaragdina, glow greener than any known reefer|Harness the ether, talk to your leaders|The seekers of beautiful bars, recording the position of the stars|Undermining these immutable laws|Correlating, DNA crossed-fading, what's the point in waiting|We're all aging, it's yours for the taking|A black hole in the making, nothing but a wound gaping|From a womb where there's no escaping|Only life-forms racing before and after mating and merry-making|With partners that aren't even facing, what are we chasing?|Our ancestors asked the same thing|And we've gotten no closer then they've been, so I prey for the day when|We don't even need eyes to confirm|The science and the poor education we've put our faith in|I don't write this to perform it, nor do I say it, to record it|I feel that I am answering a calling|Fantastic, rhyme mechanics, like that of a blind pianist|The keys are metallic, my fingers are magnets|The music is magic, what is this madness?|The stanzas are rites of passage|Your left brain habits become your baggage|The masses become savage, roaming the streets with torn fabrics|Creativity is less than average|Every baby is born a bastard, so why did you have it?|This question requires no answer, I understand it|The ""C"" of Tranquility, that is all I seek|Nothing is complete without every separate piece|The ""C"" of Tranquility, that is all I seek|Nothing is complete without every single piece|You might also like[Hook: Canbius]|The 'C' of Tranquility, what will it really be?|What does the future hold,?

Canibus,The Last Christians,2014,"The Last Christians Lyrics[Intro: Louis Farrakhan 'The Time & What Must Be Done' sample]||[Verse 1: Canibus]|Oblivious Christians, Muslims, most of them|Puppet Master controls both of them|All spoken language was created by Satan|Planet Earth is a captured operation|Lies cannot exist without speech|Humankind can't trust what they see, tell me what are your beliefs?|Are they a multiple or singular God|Do you follow 10 commandments or 10 thousand laws?|Life on Mars, what are the odds?|Do I remember being there, nah but what if I was brainwashed?|The tier one scientists, that's their main job|To teach you where you are, not where you came from|The telescope is offline, why?|The culture divides due to the confusion most of the time|History's always been sorted, important facts not reported|Real Hip Hop is not recorded|Dark forces, shadow sorcerers, de-facto black marketers|Families feuding in their corporate offices|The running man strangles Mr. Dawson outside Guy Fawkes' apartment|Right after the Boston Bombing|I'm in the pawn shop, make me an offer|Take two more derivatives and call me in the morning doctor|E.coli malaria water, earthquake victims still starving|Babies born with barcodes on their organs|Holocaust healthcare was never any better than welfare|A lot of people think it ain't fair|They should drop food from drones instead of dropping bombs|Jimmy Crack Corn from modified hormones|Soybean Tofu grow produce|Faggot ass doctor wanna grab your prostate and he don't even know you|I got nerves of steel protected from electrical surge|My curse words become medical terms|He said ""Allahu akbar"" and then blew up the plane|They said, ""God bless his radioactive remains""|Tactical protocol was changed from that moment on|The whole world's at war but not for long|They say from disaster comes peace, God bless the deceased|They had to pick up the rest of his teeth|First and last name, RFID in your brain|Shackled to some chains on a train|Close quarters, close margins, no wiggle room on the target|Stay close like titties and armpits|Bioceramic bone fragments, post apocalyptic mathematics|How do you weaponize a rabbit?|Fusion ignition, a new way of thinking just listen|Close enough to hear the laser beams whisper|[Interlude:  Speech regarding sinister leaders, speaker unknown.]||[Verse 2: Canibus]|Pyramids on every planet|Spacecrafts crash landed and disbanded, left in a sandpit|A Christian cross stands outside a crater|Faint crescent moonlike shapes glows through the vapour|21st century mega quakes shake ups|Mommy late for work with messed up make-up|Daddy lost his job, they might break up|He makes 25 cents a week (He makes what?)|The country hungry and tired, Nero is fine tuning his lyre|The empire is consumed by fire|Parliament closely monitored, school bus size comets hit Washington|People in the church talking about God again|Tsunami, what you mean God?|I mean watch the ocean seesaw up thousands of feet to the sea floor|Thought process froze, think but do not disclose|Rap music don't barter no gold|All the plaques we got were fake|Just like this horse shit reality they make you think you create|Dummies amused by the sound of their own laughter|Black gold sprays from white holes in Alaska|Didn't wanna listen when they told you|Now you eating Soybean Tofu, the government owns you|The Antichrist approaches, everybody holds their noses|They know death don't smell like roses|The minister was putting on his tube socks|Went downstairs in the elevator like 2Pac|A foreign diplomats jewel box is no match for elite rulers toolbox|Look how many rules they got|No respect, human conditional disconnect|There's nothing left, certainly less than you would dare suspect|Yet perhaps maybe there's more|Crystal quartz tuning forks, mind control forces strangle your thoughts|My land is lost and now I can't talk or walk|I cry out, ""My kingdom for a horse!""|Operation full spectrum I reviewed all of the metrics|I removed everything that was pleasant|Dig a hole to get over depression|Psycho psychic methods, if it works, then why change the method?|They control the entire globe, they say ""I don't care what you know Earthman, just do what you're told!""|Dents, Nicks, Cracks, Splints and other Swedish laments|The best poetry barely makes sense|Their pulse races, blood all over their faces|This craziness and nobody's coming to save us|His mortal wounds were heat treated, we were unable to stop the bleeding|Humans retreated, robots feeding|Boulder size rocks reeling, the Earth is squealing|Dollar crash, Wall Street didn't even feel it|Now what you gonna deal with, what you gonna eat a meal with|No tangibles? Don't even think about stealing it|Purify your h20 and stop moving so slow|You already know where we gotta go|Opsec topside, Tony Stark bomblets, rockslide|Twist metal, a bent up carbine|Sweet Caroline, double barrel time|They wanna beef, don't let em get past the cattle line|Retched, dusty ass stetson, isotope sensors|This is a community consensus|Boys will be boys, men with contaminated toys|The future is full of so much joy|Burgundy maroon John Mayer|Bluetooth black root yohimble bark player, soothsayer|Those within distance to hear, they don't care|God bless the praying prepper who is scared but prepared|A brand new world begins after pole shift planet overspin|Ahh here we go again|Modern day martyrs sing chorus|Ave verum corpus from the pinnacle of tire bale fortress|This is your world, take it back if you want it|But you can't sit at that table without a offering|Pursed lips like Mick Jagger, a bowl of hot soup cracker barrel|Raisin oatmeal and apples|Illegal 7.62 rounds in the satchel, this is unnatural|The sentence is death if they catch you|Fuel station incineration all over the nation|Devils flying all over creation|Don't open that box, it belongs to Pan|And he will compose music for the song of man|Area 51 is off limits to the intellectually timid|Humankind really has no business|If you wanna to see a fight start, turn the lights off|A dark world by a tragedy of life lostYou might also like3Embed"

See the difference between me and you is I know what I'm up against and Im'ma still go in. I know y'all got money. I know y'all got sugar daddies in high places||Tell me something nigga. Do you know who McGregor Mathers is? You don't know McGregor Mathers is Elvis' grandfather? I only met Proof one time in 2000 on Elvis' tour bus in Syracuse, New York. The nigga stepped to his business with me in defense of Elvis cause he loved Elvis. We almost came to blows on that bus over how much this nigga loved Elvis. And all I did was tell Elvis the truth about how I wasn't comfortable with what he said with that ""cancerous coulda respond back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus"" shit. I done said it a million times that I felt it was an ambiguous line to say about somebody you claim you idolized, especially with all that shit I was dealing with. That's why when Clef told me Elvis was ghostwriting for L, I didn't even understand why the fuck Elvis came to my video set for ""I Honor U"", talking 'bout ""I just want to do something with you, dog."" Everybody and their momma in this music industry turned their back on me, A&R's, DJ's, artists, fans, everybody. Twelve albums later, niggas want to act like they don't know how much I love hip-hop, and what I stand for in hip-hop, and how I don't lay down for knowing justice is against the culture. The way I feel about this shit, it goes all the way back to betrayal because at the end of the day, niggas like you only give a fuck about yourself, and devil rewards you for selling out your own niggas, real talk||Let me ask you something, Royce. Why did the nigga that used to run with Proof real tough get on the phone and tell me ""thank you"" for holding them down cause DeShaun's family was starving? This was before I wrote my fucking verse for ""Air Strike."" He told me to throw Rosenberg under the bus. He told me wasn't nobody over there eating, none of the Holtons or D12, none of them. I couldn't even believe it. I didn't even write my verse for Air Strike and this nigga's telling me ""thank you."" 'Til this day, the only way I can rationalize it is to think with my heart and know that Proof was talking to me through this nigga, telling me ""thank you"", cause after ""Air Strike"" came out, Elvis and Rosenberg doubled back to feed Holton's family. Listen, I respect D12, but how can I tell them that? Why would they listen to me? They're not gon' bite the hand that feed them, so I made it easy for niggas. I lit the wick and they cut the fuse. I gave them the chance to tell the whole world the same shit Proof told me through his man. I gave them the chance to tell the world about how they really feel about Elvis pushing them to the side to sign Voltron 5. You will have to be blind, deaf, and numb not to see how them niggas must feel right now. I guarantee you after I said that line, y'all niggas came together like a team cause y'all had a common enemy, me. Recognize what's real, nigga. Stop talking about you don't want nobody dividing you when you ain't doing nothing for niggas any goddamn way. It's fucked up cause Crook is a real nigga, and Ortiz is cool too, but you're the one that's trying to divide niggas. How you're gon' do a HRSMN record without me on it, motherfucker?||You so gangster? The fuck you're doing on Twitter talking to some fake ass account anyway? You don't think I know what's going on? You think I don't know what the fuck is going on? You think I don't know Elvis got the whole hip-hop industry on payroll, including you? How easy is it to read between those lines? I ain't seen near one site confirm what the real Canibus Twitter is. They just keep repeating the fake Twitter account to fuck me around instead of trying to rectify the problem, so when you do the HRSMN record without me on the shit, everybody gon' think I did it to myself.

Go make some fucking music and stop typing into a freaking machine||I won the whole hip hop franchise in '98 when I started my album up with a dial-up modem. I was the first MC with a website. All of a sudden, nobody in the first-world country could function without technology, but instead of niggas using this shit to be more real, they used the smoke and mirrors to make us antagonize each other with the exponential ability to brainwash the entire hip-hop generation to turn their backs on the champions of the culture, to isolate and alienate the artists who the media has purposefully blackballed, like yours truly|You know what, I'm done, man. Fuck you, Royce. You don't give a fuck about hip-hop, man. How you gon' call yourself a lyricist and disrespect me? Keep doing what your master tell you to do, 'cause there's always a company that's gon' buy you that number one spot for selling that watered-down bullshit until they switch you out.

The more you fit in, the less you're noticed?|That's how it is, for anyone to walk through life|Unnoticed as if they never mattered|Could be a punishment worse than death|And at the same time, that punishment is the only way you can truly be free|Free from the things you want people to remember about you|But also free from the things you want them to forget|I don't know if that freedom exists for me anymore|And even though I dream about what it would be like, it's just a dream|Because I realize now more than ever, that I can't have my cake and eat it, too|No one can, and as time goes on|We will always be loved by some and hated by others|And whether the people who talk bad about you know it or not|They really save you from obscurity every time they mention your name|You see, anytime anybody ever talks about you|Either directly or indirectly|They put a quarter in your immortal meter|They keep you alive, whether they want to or not|They practically do the opposite of what they wanna do, which is forget you|I dedicate this song, to the day when you motherfuckers finally figure it out|And the day that you bury me, and erase the memory of me|Here lies a man, who became forgotten to the world|In his search to the key for immortality|He never made an impact, he changed nothing|And his words meant nothing|He never contributed to the rap game|He never gave you anything to talk about|He never existed|And he never made a difference|His name was Nobody|[Hook]|Nobody|My name is nobody, my name is nobody|My name is nobody, my name is nobody|What's my name?

The more you fit in, the less you're noticed|That's how it is, for anyone to walk through life unnoticed as if they never mattered|Could be a punishment worse than death, and at the same time|That punishment is the only way you could truly be free;|Free from the things you want people to remember about you|But also free from the things you want them to forget|I don't know if that freedom exists for me anymore|And even though I dream about what it would be like|It's just a dream, because I realize now more than ever|That I can't have my cake and eat it too, no one can|And as time goes on, we will always be loved by some and hated by others|And whether the people who talk bad about you know it or not|They really save you from obscurity every time they mention your name|You see, anytime anybody ever talks about you, either directly or indirectly|They put a quarter in your immortal meter|They keep you alive, whether they want to or not|They practically do the opposite of what they want to do|Which is forget you. I dedicate this song, to the day|When you motherfuckers finally figure it out|And the day that you bury me, and erase the memory of me|Here lies a man, who became forgotten to the world|In his search to the key for immortality|He never made an impact, he changed nothing|And his words meant nothing|He never contributed to the rap game;|He never gave you anything to talk about|He never existed, and he never made a difference|His name was nobody!You might also likeEmbed"

It ain't never righteous to lie on your brother, man.  You know I'm saying, tell the truth.   If it got something to do with me and you gonna air it out to the world, tell the truth man.  I came up to the studio to discuss the track, how he was gonna do it.   He told me he was getting 80 gs a track from Christina Aguilera.  The seven tracks she was hype, he was all cheesy and smiling.  He was happy about it.  He charged me 40 Gs for the track we was gonna do.  Eloise cut you the check, sent you your first half, scheduled the studio time.  I came up to D & D, dirty ass D & D.  First day he was an hour late, second day he was two hours late, third day he was three hours late, fourth day he was four hours late.  Come on man, tell the truth. When I stepped to you asked you ""Yo, tomorrow are you gonna be, are you gonna be five hours late tomorrow?"" You say ""Yo, my bad Bis, I had to move my mother out of the house.""  So I say ""All right, just call man, just call and let me know what you're doing you busy so I don't have to wait for you.  So I don't have to wait in the studio, because I got shit to do.  Everybody got shit to do around 5 o'clock in the evening.""  Come on now.  I don't know what it is man.   Niggas bringing up some shit from 14 years ago.   Like that shit is current news, like it's important now.  What's important now? How's that important?  Look how many times we work together since then, or how many times I seen you since then.    And then everybody want to know what's wrong with the culture. Know what I'm sayin'? Come on man, it's not a good look.   How does that help anyone in this situation except you?  How does it help me to for you to be out there saying I'm difficult to work with?  How does that help me?  How does it help you? You kick dirt on me, that helps you though.  Right?  Make you feel better, right?   Come on now, tell the truth.  You was late to the studio like you didn't take it serious.  Like it wasn't important to you.  You shovel shit on me like I wasn't 100% professional in working with you.  Like I didn't come through to the sessions and wait for 10 hours. I worked with DR Period on ""Salute.""  Everything was dope.  Ask DR Period how our studio session was, how I was professional.   Ask Flat Top how I was professional.  I had to go to Rakim's crib five times before he did the record. But he did it.   And the days before the day that he wrote it, he was just building, and I enjoyed it.  Why you don't speak on that?  Speak on the shit that's good for hip hop.   Good for you, and good for me.   Why shovel shit on me for no reason? Who you working for? What agenda you have?  How are you helping hip hop by doing that?   I do my best on every track.  I go hard on every record.   But you wanna go on TV and radio and what have you, and say ""Yeah Canibus was this and Canibus was that"" for no reason!     14 years ago.  Why you don't talk about what we did on C of Tranquility.  Come on now tell the truth.   Every album I do the best that I can do, the best that circumstances will admit me at that time.  Nobody's perfect, but God damn it if I don't give it everything though, 100 at all times.  And it's as if there is some sort of movement, or some sort of deliberate attempt to always, when it comes to Canibus, that's always bringing up old shit, something from 14, 15 years ago.  Always old shit.  Never what's currently coming out of Canibus's catalogue,  what he's doing currently.  And it's like a deliberate attempt by the media and everybody who got a motherfuckin' microphone in their hand and five minutes to do a little video bite to talk about old shit when my name come up.  Cause it's always comin' up somewhere.  It's always comin' up.  And to combat that pressure niggas is talkin' about old shit instead of what most recently came out. Talk about the Magick album and what was being said on that album.  Talk about C of Tranquility and the topics and subject matter touched on that.  Talk about something that relevant to now.   Don't bring up some old shit that ain't got nothing to do with nothing.  Come on now. You know what you doing.  Ran that baton for so far, man.  You ain't never supposed to say something foul about the kid man.   How does that help you?  The irony about it is, that you smilin' talkin over it. It's bad for me but you smiling though. And when I get a little uptight about it, say something about it, everybody look at me like I'm out of bounds, and I'm out of bounds.  You the one that's smiling, lying. You already knew!  And when I say aight, tell the truth.  Tell the truth what happened.  Tell them niggas you was the one who was late to the studio, every day you was late.  Come on now tell the motherfuckin' truth man, tell the truth.  It's like you didn't want to do the record||[Outro]|Everything about you and your body language is telling me|You didn't wanna do the recordEmbed"

The more you fit in, the less you're noticed?|That's how it is, for anyonе to walk through life|Unnoticed as if they nеver mattered|Could be a punishment worse than death|And at the same time, that punishment is the only way you can truly be free|Free from the things you want people to remember about you|But also free from the things you want them to forget|I don't know if that freedom exists for me anymore|And even though I dream about what it would be like, it's just a dream|Because I realize now more than ever, that I can't have my cake and eat it, too|No one can, and as time goes on|We will always be loved by some and hated by others|And whether the people who talk bad about you know it or not|They really save you from obscurity every time they mention your name|You see, anytime anybody ever talks about you|Either directly or indirectly|They put a quarter in your immortal meter|They keep you alive, whether they want to or not|They practically do the opposite of what they wanna do, which is forget you|I dedicate this song, to the day when you motherfuckers finally figure it out|And the day that you bury me, and erase the memory of me|Here lies a man, who became forgotten to the world|In his search to the key for immortality|He never made an impact, he changed nothing|And his words meant nothing|He never contributed to the rap game|He never gave you anything to talk about|He never existed|And he never made a difference|His name was NobodyYou might also likeEmbed"

Frozen|Your skin? Smoldered|Overheated and swollen, steaming and smoking|And stinking through clothing|I need a moment to go breathe in the open|Fucking rappers got me sicker than Covid|And you know this, still the dopest|Free the people like Moses|Hyper focused with both barrels loaded, 'cause I'm a Poet|And when my palanquin pull up, climb aboard, let's go Bis|Peep the components, Pete Rock, Can-I-Bus bonus|Shoulder to shoulder|In foxhole with speedloaders|Lord Cyborg soldiers|Hot fire like Dylan told ya, nugguhYou might also likeEmbed"
