Chance the Rapper,Q&A with Rolling Stone (Comments on Labels),,"Q&A with Rolling Stone (Comments on Labels) LyricsDoes it feel like an eternity since Acid Rap?|It feels way shorter. Every day is a workday. It's hard to explain. When you're working on shit every day and it comes back full circle three months later, it doesn't hit you the same way. Cause it's something I knew I was working on.||Can you gauge your increasing fame?|Definitely. I do recognize it all the time. But it's not like . . . I don't necessarily feed into the whole newfound-fame type shit, or feeling like a different person. If anything, it makes me realize how fleeting and unreal it all is. It's all just about perspective. I just feel like it's not real. It's real, but only in the way it affects those around you. Fame or perceived success – it all comes from groupthink.||...||Have you thought about signing with a label?|There's no reason to. It's a dead industry.||Is it also because you like maintaining direct control over your career?|I don't really have control over my direct impression on people anymore. I used to be the person putting my CD in people's hands. But I'm kind of a mainstream artist now. Not by choice. Not by what I make or anything. But just by that ripple-effect shit.|||When will we get an Acid Rap follow-up?|The whole point of Acid Rap was just to ask people a question: does the music business side of this dictate what type of project this is? If it's all original music and it's got this much emotion around it and it connects this way with this many people, is it a mixtape? What's an album these days, anyways? Cause I didn't sell it, does that mean it's not an official release? So I might not ever drop a for-sale project. Maybe I'll just make my money touring.7Embed"
